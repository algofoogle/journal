I started working on the [PongGame tutorial](https://www.fpga4fun.com/PongGame.html) with [`test07a`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/tree/master/fpga/XC9572XL/test07/t07a).

For now this is just a rip-off of the early part of the PongGame code, which I haven't tried to analyse: I just made a small VGA adapter to wire up to my CPLD board, and needed something to prove that it works, along with my crappy old 15&Prime; VGA monitor.

The monitor brightness, alignment, and stability isn't perfect. Not sure whether it's the monitor itself (from having been in the shed for years) or if it's my CPLD, cross-talk, or whatever.

I'd like to try and work this one out myself, from VGA timing specs, etc.

I'd also like to go back to some LED PWM stuff per [`test06a`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/tree/master/fpga/XC9572XL/test06/t06a).
