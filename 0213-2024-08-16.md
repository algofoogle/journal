# Completed csdac_nom initial layout for tt08-vga-fun

As of [commit 57c6665](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt08-vga-fun/commit/57c666569821acda33754b86808e2e524a1fb9dd) I've got a completed initial layout for csdac_nom:

![csdac_nom initial layout](i/0213-csdac_nom-layout.png)

It seems to be DRC clean and fractionally smaller than 57x60um. To my surprise, LVS passed on the first go:

```
$ PROJECT_NAME=csdac_nom make clean lvs
...
Contents of circuit 1:  Circuit: 'csdac_nom'
Circuit csdac_nom contains 28 device instances.
  Class: sky130_fd_pr__nfet_01v8 instances:  25
  Class: sky130_fd_pr__res_high_po_5p73 instances:   2
  Class: sky130_fd_pr__pfet_01v8 instances:   1
Circuit contains 29 nets.
Contents of circuit 2:  Circuit: 'csdac_nom'
Circuit csdac_nom contains 28 device instances.
  Class: sky130_fd_pr__nfet_01v8 instances:  25
  Class: sky130_fd_pr__res_high_po_5p73 instances:   2
  Class: sky130_fd_pr__pfet_01v8 instances:   1
Circuit contains 29 nets.

Circuit 1 contains 28 devices, Circuit 2 contains 28 devices.
Circuit 1 contains 29 nets,    Circuit 2 contains 29 nets.


Final result: 
Circuits match uniquely.

Features of the layout include:
*   Positive and negative (i.e. inverted) digital inputs (8 bit pairs) across the top, on m1.
*   vcc and vss ports in the top-left, on m4. These branch out on m4 and m3, and are typically all 1um wide where they carry current -- should allow up to about 1.5mA (where we only need 0.5mA).
*   Analog output ports in the bottom-right corner. Probably only Vneg will be used but there's also its complement (Vpos) and the bias voltage (Vbias) for the current-source transistors.
*   Vbias reference generator is the pair of transistors in the top-left corner.
*   Left-hand half, from top to bottom, is triplets of transistors that steer current for bits 7, 6, 5, 4, and 3.
*   Right-hand half, from top to bottom, is the same for bits 2, 1, and 0. NOTE: Because these are very LONG transistors (as opposed to wide), they are rotated 90&deg; compared with the left-hand column, and in this case I've got the Vbias m1 strap going across the channel. Not sure if that's a bad idea.
*   Big pull-up resistors on the right for each of Vpos and Vneg. These need to be this large for current capacity, i.e. I want to keep them under the 100uA/um recommended limit, and these are 5.73um wide (thus 573uA gives enough headroom).


# Extraction and simulation

```bash
PROJECT_NAME=csdac_nom make csdac_nom.sim.spice
```

This produces `mag/csdac_nom.sim.spice` with a large number of parasitic resistors and capacitors, as expected. To my surprise, the port order is sensible (even though the port numbers are odd in the .mag file):

```spice
.subckt csdac_nom_parax p0 n0 p1 n1 p2 n2 p3 n3 p4 n4 p5 n5 p6 n6 p7 n7 vcc vss Vpos Vneg Vbias
```

Back in `xschem/` I copied `tb_csdac.sch` to `tb_csdac_nom.sch` and edited it to specifically use `csdac_nom` (rather than the parametric version, `csdac`). I also copied `csdac.sym` to `csdac_nom.sym` and fixed that up to make it an easy drop-in.

Create a 2nd copy of the main DUT schematic, name its outputs to include `_pex` as a suffix, then edit the 2nd instance (that will represent the layout/parasitic-extraction version) to include:

```
schematic=csdac_nom_parax.sim
spice_sym_def="tcleval(.include [file normalize ../mag/csdac_nom.sim.spice])"
tclcommand="textwindow [file normalize ../mag/csdac_nom.sim.spice]"
```

I adjusted the graph a little (taking out Vpos) and the performance seems pretty consistent, though Vbias_pex is a little flat, meaning less current through the transistors:

# Next steps

## Digital block and integration

The 3v3 1x2 TT layout is 136.14um x 225.76um. For some reason there's an extra region on the RHS that is unusable but visible. I don't know what that is.

Usable area in the layout is probably about 125x215um.

The remaining usable area for a digital block would be about 125x145um:

If I needed more, I could forget the 3v3 experiment, or go for 2x2 tiles.

I can't remember what hardening size I got to for my updated Verilog (inc. improved features, line debug, etc.). It might've been [this from 0205 (2024-05-30)](https://github.com/algofoogle/journal/blob/master/0205-2024-05-30.md#hardening); if so, I got a 117x117um harden apparently.

Ah, it's obvious why it had to be a lot smaller originally: https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/main/docs/info.md -- the RDACs dominate.

## Other stuff

*   Don't forget to check out: https://github.com/htfab/flash-adc/tree/main/xschem -- borrow buffer, vfollower, opamp?




# Other possible improvements

*   Digitally switch different Vbias levels, or even make Vbias an INPUT driven by another circuit (e.g. differently-sized current reference resistors that can be switched).
*   Go back to Xschem and see if we can fix the imperfect balancing of the current transistors.
*   Option to switch different pull-up resistors (or just turn them off and do an external pull-up).
