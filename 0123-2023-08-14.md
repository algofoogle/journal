This is a very quick update, in the few minutes I've got.

Been on a bit of a hiatus due to personal obligations. Getting back into this now. Started work recently on [raybox-zero] as a minimal alternative to [Raybox][], hoping to target TT04.

Setting up new laptop in the process. Had to install MSYS2 which was a bit wacky. See [here](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero#running-verilator-simulation-on-windows) for more info.

raybox-zero (or rbzero for short) can now be run in my Verilator-based simulator on Windows at least.

I've implemented some basic skeleton modules in it so it can drive a VGA display and do row rendering (instead of column rendering now). Also got the beginnings of a tracer that now only needs to trace one row at a time. LZC and reciprocal modules are implemented, and an initial test shows they seem to work as expected.

Next steps:
*   Set up VirtualBox VM to help with writing journals.
*   Vector registers; worry about updating later.
*   Map ROM.
*   Map/debug overlays to prove they're working?
*   Row tracer.
