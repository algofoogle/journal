*   I want to see if I can get `pace_old` working, ideally in 64-bit mode, but 32-bit mode if necessary.
*   NOTE: "[PACE](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/help/iseguide/mergedProjects/destech/html/cd_assigning_pins_in_chipviewer.htm#:~:text=PACE%20is%20a%20graphical%20interface,to%20a%20specific%20Xilinx%20device.&text=PACE%20allows%20you%20to%20make,you%20can%20automatically%20create%20a%20.)" (see also [this](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx11/ise_c_pin_assignment_pace.htm)) is [Pinout and Area Constraints Editor](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/help/iseguide/mergedProjects/pace/html/pace_b_overview.htm).
*   Downloading ISE 14.7 VM on a Mac. Can I manually install the OVA in VirtualBox 6.1.6 on macOS 10.15.5?
*   Doco [here](https://alchitry.com/pages/installing-ise) on getting ISE (Windows 7 version) to work on different platforms, *including* Windows 10. Note that this version probably won't support CPLDs, but maybe we can hack that in later from the 14.7 Linux VM. [This](https://alchitry.com/pages/installing-ise#:~:text=Creating%20a%20launcher%20in%20Linux) is where things might start getting interesting too.
*   Maybe [this](http://www.sethdepot.org/site/HdlLsiHardwareVendorsXilinxIseSW.html) will likewise be handy?
*   In future, for Spartan 3E, etc, [this](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/fpga/guide-getting-xilinx-ise-to-work-with-windows-8-64-bit/) might be handy.
*   Need to investigate Timing Analysis stuff in UCF, to get rid of warnings and hopefully help registers.
*   [This guy](https://www.philipzucker.com/install-webpack-ise-14-7-ubuntu-spartan-ax309-fpga-board/) had some trouble. Maybe his findings will help? That's for Ubuntu, but might provide a guide for Red Hat (14.7 VM default) too.
*   A partial list [here](http://www.siliconpr0n.com/eda/doku.php/xilinx:cli) of Xilinx ISE tools.
*   Will the [XC9500XL BSDL files](files/0021/xc9500xl.zip) help with working out manual UCF pin planning for the XC9572XL-7-VQ64? Interestingly:
    *   Our LEDs are on `FB1-2` (pin 8) and `FB2-17` (pin 7).
    *   [xc9572xl_vq64.bsd](files/0021/xc9572xl_vq64.bsd) *sort of implies* that these respectively would be known internally as `PB00_01` and `PB01_16`. It appears there are no `FB*-1` pins named on the package, in the [datasheet](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds057.pdf#page=6). The datasheet naming of the pins doesn't match the BSDL. The TQ100 package *does* range from `FB1-1` up to `FB1-18`, though.
    *   The BSDL also does imply that `PB00_01` is `P8` and `PB01_16` is `P7`.
*   So, I'm not sure why my code targeting the XC9572XL-7-VQ64 seemed to leave the LEDs in a state where the LEDs were dim. They were probably dim due to WPUs (weak pull-ups), but shouldn't they have had some value assigned from reset? Need to try some direct `assign`s instead, and test the theory on both the VQ44 and VQ64.
*   Interesting info re BSDL [here](https://bsdl.info/details.htm?sid=e596df5721e3e10b88ca59b002289d77).
*   Learn how to do simulation and timing analysis to make sure I understand Verilog correctly.
*   I wonder if the problem is that iMPACT (or the synthesis step) didn't use my UCF. Does the report show what pins it used? I've noticed that [`test02.gyd`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/4f4f00a3cd828e72d31a7270c61331c71f32281d/fpga/XC9572XL/test02/test02.gyd#L3) (a "[guide file](https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/1270.html)") contains this:
    ```
    9572XL64 XC9572XL-7-VQ64
    SW1 S:PIN57
    SW2 S:PIN15
    D2 S:PIN60
    D3 S:PIN22
    ```
    On a VQ64, those pins would be:
    *   SW1: P57 = FB4-17
    *   SW2: P15 = FB1-9
    *   D2: P60 = FB2-2
    *   D3: P22 = FB3-2

    Note that this is all very hard to read, but if look at [`test02.mfd`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/4f4f00a3cd828e72d31a7270c61331c71f32281d/fpga/XC9572XL/test02/test02.mfd#L21-L22), we see these mystery numbers `87` (for D2) and `29` (for D3). These appear to match [pin 60](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/master/fpga/XC9572XL/test02/test02.jed#L56) and [pin 22](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/master/fpga/XC9572XL/test02/test02.jed#L24) in the `.jed` file, so maybe that *is* what got programmed for some reason...?

    Compare this with [`test02.pnx`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/master/fpga/XC9572XL/test02/test02.pnx) and we get the same numbers again. Maybe I forgot to synth again after creating my `.ucf`??

    Note that [`test02.rpt`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/master/fpga/XC9572XL/test02/test02.rpt#L29) shows that `SW2` is `mapped onto global clock net GCK1` (no doubt for clocking my latch logic). `I/O/GCK1` is pin 15, which shows up in `test02.pnx` too. Is that going to a problem, or does it wire that up internally itself, without changing my outside pin assignment?

    There was also [this warning](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/4f4f00a3cd828e72d31a7270c61331c71f32281d/fpga/XC9572XL/test02/test02.rpt#L53-L54) and maybe that implies that it didn't use my correct `test02.ise` project but rather built its own, hence the arbitrary pin assignments?

    OK [this does look wrong](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/master/fpga/XC9572XL/test02/test02.rpt#L55-L85)...?

*   I need some sort of breakout that shows the state of all IO pins as LEDs. SMT assembly from JLC? PTH LED bars that I already have?
*   In next version of breakout board, do better refs/naming/placement of LEDs and buttons. Maybe space for more LEDs, too. They don't have to be populated, remember.

*   There are lots of little examples, now, in [`test03`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/tree/master/fpga/XC9572XL/test03). They just need ISE projects made, etc.
