# What next?

*   Been a while since I stopped hard work on stuff after completing the TT04 submission.
*   I did the VGA DAC PCB submission to JLCPCB yesterday.
*   Next thing I'd like to look at is related to TT05 and/or chipIgnite.
*   I should plan that Nov 19th to Nov 25th is YouTube video time.
*   I've got maybe 20 "normal" concentration days left of my leave.

# High-level stuff to work on

*   Reading
*   Catch up on watching YT videos
*   Build TT05 project repo
*   Try putting texture loading (via SPI) into raybox-zero. **Don't forget QSPI**. What SPI hardware options do I have?
    *   DE0-Nano EEPROM: only 2kb, i.e. 256 bytes? Adequate POC maybe but minimum texture is 32x32xRGB111 which is 3kb.
    *   Pi Pico SPI sim (per RebelMike).
    *   Do I have any SPI memories kicking around?
    *   DE0-Nano has parallel-like SDRAM: Could we give it an external SPI-like interface?
    *   Could my XC9572XL device be made to work as an SPI RAM? Remember Gisselquist Technology SPI controller ([here?](https://opencores.org/websvn/filedetails?repname=xulalx25soc&path=%2Fxulalx25soc%2Ftrunk%2Fdoc%2Fqspispec.pdf)) and [this one](https://opencores.org/projects/spi/).
    *   SD-card??
    *   Plan also for SPI chip on TT motherboard??
*   Learn Pi Pico SPI controller coding.

# Other notes

*   Formal verification: https://zipcpu.com/formal/2023/07/18/sdrxframe.html
*   [Intel LPC](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/program/design/us/en/documents/low-pin-count-interface-specification.pdf) (Low Pin-Count) interface could be handy for TT05?
    *   SST49LF020 might allow 5-wire access but also parallel access inc. separate row and column parallel address multiplexing, which is interesting for map scanning.
    *   I have some SST49LF008.
