## Still poking around with Verilator

*   I don't think it's possible to manipulate Verilog `parameter`s with Verilator. Probably not an issue, though: I guess a higher-level Verilog module in the hierarchy could set parameters of submodules, as it sees fit, and then the Verilator-based testbench would just manipulate the signals it cares about to drive things.
*   Nice suggestion [here](https://www.embecosm.com/appnotes/ean6/html/ch06s02s04.html) about abstracting deep hierarchical signal access in C++.

In [`t01e`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/tree/master/fpga/verilator/test01/t01e) I added basic Verilator `trace` support, logging to `trace.vcd`.

To see what was changed to add this (including adding the `--trace` switch to `verilator` in the `Makefile`), see the differences in [this commit](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/commit/f23d9678b2cff2838b4a361168fcae8d821b1386).

Next step is to install GTKWave and try checking out the `trace.vcd` file that it generates.


## Other notes

*   Learn more about Verilog tasks.
