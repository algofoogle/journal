## Geeetech A10 3D Printer

*   I've ordered a [Geeetech A10](https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/B07MNZ4YYQ?ref=ppx_pt2_dt_b_prod_image) 3D Printer from Amazon Australia. It's AU$329.
*   This is my first time ordering from Amazon Australia, and I opted for express shipping. Ordered on Wed, guaranteed delivery by Monday.
*   I added on [white PLA](https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/B07M9YG2Z5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (AU$24.99) and [blue PLA](https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/B07ZMLLG6K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (AU$21.49) filaments.
*   I chose the Geeetech A10 because:
    *   It's a good price.
    *   It's a clone of the Creality Ender 3 which gets mixed reviews, but is generally held to be adequate, affordable, and Open Source.
    *   Supposedly it has some improvements over the Creality Ender 3, including a superior hotbed surface.
    *   Unlike the Creality, it comes mostly pre-assembled.
    *   The build volume is pretty good (220&times;220&times;260mm).
    *   It supports USB and SD Card data transfer.
    *   There is an optional [Wi-Fi module](https://www.geeetech.com/geeetech-3d-wifi-module-for-3d-printer-p-1018.html).
*   Disadvantages:
    *   Need to manually level the bed. Doesn't seem too hard, though, and hopefully doesn't need to be done often.
    *   Fan(s) might (?) be a little noisy.

Next steps:

*   Build the printer and do the initial test run with one of the pre-loaded models on the supplied SD card: [User manual](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1EbqG2gCsS.pdf)
*   Try getting some STL files and try slicing with Cura.
*   Try creating a model with Tinkercad or Fusion 360.
