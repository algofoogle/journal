# Belated update (TT chips, and analog)

Since my last update I:

*   Started working at [Efabless](https://efabless.com), during the busy April 2024 tapeout period.
*   Completed an analog submission to TT06, called [tt06-grab-bag]
*   Started looking at a unity gain voltage buffer or other opamp solution for redoing my DACs on TT07.
*   Received my TT03 chip/board, and TT03p5 (alpha).


# Notes

*   Change xschem default terminal from `xterm` to `gnome-terminal`:
    *   In local `xschemrc`, near line 289, add: `set terminal { gnome-terminal }`
    *   Anton's 'Ngspice interactive' line *was*: `$terminal -fa 'Monospace' -fs 14 -e {ngspice -i "$N" -a || sh}`
    *   Replaced with: `$terminal --zoom=1.5 -- bash -c "ngspice -i \"$N\" -a || sh"`
    *   NOTE: Potential conflict between local `xschemrc` (setting the terminal) and the modified terminal config line (which seems to be global).
*   System-wide Magic config file: `/usr/local/lib/magic/sys/.magicrc`

# TODO

*   Doco for [tt06-grab-bag]
*   Prep TT07 submission
*   Try voltage buffers on R2R DAC output -- bias it: DAC currently gives `[0, 1.8V]`, but ideally we want `[0, 0.7V]`.
*   Clean up VM(s)
