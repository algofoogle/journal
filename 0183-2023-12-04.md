# Continue trying to fix rbz-fsm harden for GF180

    *   Is it possible to make these existing vios much WORSE to see if we can better-understand what influences them? e.g. make the reg chain much longer?
    *   What if we try registering LAs on the negedge of clk instead of pos?
    *   Is the violation *where they get registered* or is it downstream?
    *   Is the problem partly to do with wire lengths/placement/capacitance?
    *   Can the issue be fixed with deliberate delay lines? They'd probably have to be pretty long delays! But what about a simple inverter at each end?

Interesting: We went from 0.2/0.1 to 1.5/1.5. It sort of looks like it made LA holds worse by an average of -0.7, and the rest (non-vios) better...?

It took way longer to run!

# Test 10

*   Remove hold slack margin tweaks (inc. PL/GLB buffers).
*   Bring reg chain depth from 32 back down to 2, and clock it on negedge.

FAILED! Tiny hold violations in TEA, one in particular: `i_clk` startpoint, viol is -0.03. Maybe we could correct this with hold slack margin tweaks again?


# Test 11

*   Put hold slack margin tweaks/buffers back in, but back to 0.2/0.1.

FAILED! No change to hold violations in TEA.


# Test 12

*   Use these config adjustments:
    ```json
    "PL_RESIZER_HOLD_SLACK_MARGIN": 0.4,
    "GLB_RESIZER_HOLD_SLACK_MARGIN": 0.4,
    "PL_RESIZER_HOLD_MAX_BUFFER_PERCENT": 70,
    "GLB_RESIZER_HOLD_MAX_BUFFER_PERCENT": 70,
    ```

Succeeded in TEA, failed in UPW, but now it's just setup vios. Could be fixed by dropping UPW clock?


# Test 13

*   Remove hold slack margins again.
*   Remove reg on LA (conditional precompilation).
*   Fix up SDC stuff:
    *   Name ports according to what our design actually has.
    *   Use `set_multicycle_path` on LA-driven ports.
*   Can optionally use `"SYNTH_AUTONAME": true` to help trace vios.

Results: TBC

TEA failed with setup vios, UPW did not run. Cause seems to relate to using `reset` condition just to halt regs in `tex_sclk` block, and we can probably live without that (or give it a multicycle constraint).


# Test 14

*   Remove reset check condition from `posedge tex_sclk` block.
*   Remember to fix up Verilator!

Results: TBC

TEA: Worst setup slack is 7.80, so we could probably run our clock faster than 44ns.

UPW: 617 hold vios, again all on LAs. Ranging up to -2.02. 1x LA[3], 1x LA[8], all the others are on LA[0] (reset).


# Test 15

*   Speed up clock: CLOCK_PERIOD of 40ns
*   See what effect it has on slew, fanout, caps, hold vios in UPW.


# Test 16

*   Increase FP_CORE_UTIL and PL_TARGET_DENSITY
*   See what effect it has on slew, fanout, caps, hold vios in UPW.


# Test 17

*   Clock from user_clock2 instead of wb_clk_i


# Test 18

*   SDC: Relax constraints on LA-based pins. Do we want `-hold 2` or `-hold 1`? Put this in macro SDC, or UPW SDC? If we do the latter, then it could affect other designs...?


# Test 19

Ideas:

*   set_false_path 
*   user_clock2 for the design
*   user_clock2 just for LA regs
*   Halve the clocking of the LA regs?
*   SDC relax LAs -- besides 'reset', they don't actually change... they just get set to a constant value.
*   SDC, look into: "Multicycle Paths: Specifies exceptions where certain paths are allowed multiple cycles for setup and hold times."
*   Use edge detector on LAs??
*   Use WB instead of LA


NOTE: We don't strictly need a reliable signal on gpout_sels, just on LA-driven reset. Can we tell SDC not to care?

NOTE: Maybe registering reset_alt on negedge is bad because all the rest of the design relies on it being sync'd with clk?

NOTE: If we HAD to, we could just get rid of all the LA interface.

# Test 20

*   Change pin ordering
*   Change clock speed: Decrease TEA period from 44 to 


# Test 21

*   Try using user_clock2 (inc. SDC `usr_*` stuff) -- maybe user_clock2 can be used specifically for clocking LA reg, and keep wb_clk_i for main design?


# Test 22

*   Fix (or at least decide on) user_defines
*   FSM wrapper for SHMUL
*   Try 40ns CLOCK_PERIOD for TEA
*   Test on FPGA too


# Test 23

*   Run a matrix of tests. Assuming TEA takes 15:30 and UPW takes 3:30, it's 19 mins for each permutation. That's:
    *   19 runs in 6:01 hours.
    *   25 runs in 7:55 hours. Example: 3x FP_CORE_UTIL, 2x hold margins, 2x setup margins, 2x PL_TARGET_DENSITY = 24
    *   32 runs in 10:08 hours. Example: 4x FP_CORE_UTIL, 4x PL_TARGET_DENSITY, 2x allow setup vios?
*   I think there's a parameter to allow larger global placement for better timing...?


# Test 24

*   If necessary, just get rid of the LA stuff
*   Try reducing density
*   Are there any SDC constraints we can put in to help things?
*   Move macro placement


# Other notes / Next steps

*   Write a runner/aggregator for TEA/UPW run results. Beware disk space.
