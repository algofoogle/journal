# Next steps for Raybox

Several of these are borrowed from older "Next steps" in other journal entries:

## Easy

*   Include an option for 8-bit writes into the vector registers (to be compatible with
    old CPUs, but also for more speed).
*   On reset:
    *   Ensure `ready_buffer` has initial vector data that will be loaded into vector registers.
    *   Make sure `spi_done` is not asserted.
*   Implement an externally accessible 
*   Build R2R VGA DAC.
*   IRQs for various things, esp. frame start.
*   Plan some extra debugging signals.

## Time/Effort

*   Make better use of Verilog modules, e.g. to make the SPI part generic.
*   Make it possible to disable some modules to simplilfy the design (e.g. no sprites, no textures).
*   Try converting some modules into Tiny Tapeout targets.
*   Consider an overall reduced design for Tiny Tapeout: 160x120 res, 16x16 map, lower fixed-point resolution...?
*   Try RP2040 SPI hardware instead of bit-banging.
*   Check the SPI logic to make sure it's not possible for a write to be lost (or otherwise cause a conflict)
    if it occurs exactly at the key moments (like buffer &rarr; ready transfer).
    *   Try setting up a testbench for this?
*   Write a testbench; cocotb, Verilog, or both.
*   See if we can correct textures so they don't mirror on certain wall sides.
*   Try compacting vectors; they don't need to be so big.
*   Implement resource/instance sharing, e.g. for reciprocal and some multiplication?
    Prove that it actually simplifies the design.
    *   Need to get solid metrics from OpenLane/Yosys before making changes!
    *   Check utilisation also in Quartus; beware multiplier blocks!
    *   Need to also check timing, inc. both FPGA reports and OpenSTA.
*   [Doors](https://github.com/nicklockwood/RetroRampage/blob/master/Tutorial/Part10.md).
*   Configurable early frame end (to devote more lines to tracing time).
*   Are there any magnitude comparators we could reduce by replacing with equality checks and tracking by registers?

## Difficult

*   Implement external memory access, first for map data, then texture data?
    *   If Raybox 640x480 is too optimistic and we can't get a good route that runs fast enough,
        we could do 400x300 by using the above 800x600@56 mode, and then we only need an 18MHz clock
        (which means timing for external RAM is even more generous: ~55ns). Other option is maybe
        [320x200](http://tinyvga.com/vga-timing/640x400@70Hz), which could work with a 12.5MHz clock,
        and would produce probably a reasonably compact layout...?
    *   If we use a 50MHz core, but just clock out 25MHz or even 12.5MHz to VGA, will this help the design
        set up external memory timing in a more structured way?
*   Work on multiple sprites.
*   Learn Static Timing Analysis, and setting timing constraints.
*   Quasi-floating-point for trace distance data.
*   Greater colour depth than RGB222.
*   Consider running some parts of the design at 50MHz.
*   Design for different VGA resolutions/clocks.
*   Consider pipelines, e.g. is there a way to pipeline the reciprocal so it can
    get to a result without having to cascade its combo logic too far?
*   Find out how to define actual RAM blocks in Verilog
*   Learn OpenRAM and DFFRAM
*   Optimising to get the design to fit in Caravel without compromising:
    *   Sprite positions probably only need ~6 bits of sub-unit precision. In fact, they only need about Q6.6 (unsigned)?
    *   Player position could be reduced to Q6.12 (unsigned)?
    *   Facing and vplane vectors could be reduced to Q2.12 (signed). This allows vectors in the range [-2.0,2.0)
    *   Trace buffer could be converted to OpenRAM.
    *   Fewer IOs
    *   Implement shared resources (i.e. for reciprocals and multiplication)
    *   Plan/implement external ROMs
*   Option to change height scaling for different FOVs. What is the Wolf3D FOV, etc??

## Specific raybox-bridge stuff

*   Momentum
*   [Wall collisions](https://github.com/nicklockwood/RetroRampage/blob/master/Tutorial/Part2.md)
*   Map overlay
*   Reset and other debugging controls sent to design on other GPIOs
