No journal updates for last 4 months: Personal time was mostly taken up by work or projects for friends.

## Getting into FPGAs

I'm going to finally study programmable logic and FPGAs.

*   I've ordered a [DE0-Nano from element14](https://au.element14.com/terasic-technologies/p0082/e22f17c6n-de0-nano-dev-kit/dp/2076463).
*   [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/) will be good for learning Verilog and simulating designs.
*   [fpga4fun.com](https://www.fpga4fun.com/MusicBox.html) will be good for tutorials.
*   Not sure what practical projects I'll do first.
*   I can start learning with my [Dangerous Prototypes XC9572XL CPLD board](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/XC9500XL_CPLD_breakout_board).
*   My [OBLS](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Open-Workbench-Logic-Sniffer-p-612.html) will probably also come in handy. Still need to upgrade the firmware on that thing.
*   [CPLD Quick Start Guide](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Xilinx_XC9500XL_CPLD_quick_start#Clock_source) and [CPLD practical guide here](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/CPLD:_Complex_programmable_logic_devices#CPLD_development_tutorials) will help too.

## CPLD board design

*   I'm going to try copying the DP CPLD board; it's a 5V-tolerant part so it could be used with the NES project I was working on a while back.
*   Beware: the original CPLD board's [schematics](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/images/c/cd/Cct-XC9572XL-CPLD-breakout-lv.png) have [a bug on `IO3-8`](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/XC9572XL_dev-board_v1_errors).
*   A while back I'd ordered a couple of [XC9572XL-10VQ64](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/2PCS-XC9572XL-10VQG/153107227490?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649) ICs (64-pin version as opposed to the CPLD board's 44-pin version). [Basic datasheet](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds057.pdf) mostly shows pinouts for various packages. [Family guide](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds054.pdf) has more about the XC9500 range and how to use it.
*   [Ian Lesnet's assembly video](http://dangerousprototypes.com/blog/2011/08/10/cpld-breakout-board-v1a-prototype/) might be handy.
