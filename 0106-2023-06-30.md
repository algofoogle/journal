# Quick update on vga_cursor with circle-cursor test

*   With the circle-cursor generator running on PicoDeo, a telltale sign of the behaviour
    we want to get rid of is that sometimes the cursor appears as a long arc, or as a
    parallelogram. This means that the cursor reference point is changing through each
    scanline, without the design having a registered reference.
    Otherwise, the cursor would appear as a square.
*   I've noticed ways to more-easily see glitching on the vga_cursor raw GPIO inputs:
    *   Half-unplug the PicoDeo while circle-cursor is running.
    *   Just pull out the PicoDeo and touch the header pins with my finger.
*   Doing it this way I think creates more uncertainty on some inputs, and picks up other
    interference, which means a much less stable input signal (which is what we want).
*   Hence, our goal is to make THAT "work", i.e. always present nothing but a square cursor,
    even if it is skipping around the screen randomly.
