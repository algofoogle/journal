## `test05f`

Per https://www.fpga4fun.com/MusicBox3.html I made [`test05/t05f`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/tree/master/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05f) which is almost exactly the code given in the tutorial.

It also shows how [you can XOR vectors of bits together](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/9c650510f251c08356d92a047b63e75fcc656db0/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05f/test05f.v#L9), though.

It works! Just note that what it names each note (i.e. A, B, C, etc.) doesn't match the standard A-440 frequencies.
*   Base frequencies come from a [look-up table of base periods](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/9c650510f251c08356d92a047b63e75fcc656db0/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05f/music.v#L23-L42) that has 9-bit values, with `9'b111111111` (512-1) being the higest variant, and each subsequent value being divided by a factor of `2^(n/12)`, i.e. such that the 10th semitone (`G`) has a period of `512/2^(10/12)-1` (or `287-1`).
*   This period is then effectively multiplied by the [octave counter](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/9c650510f251c08356d92a047b63e75fcc656db0/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05f/music.v#L58), which is based on 2 to the power of 3..8.
*   Hence, the lowest octave `A` note has a *duty cycle* of length 512*256 or 131072, hence a frequency of 25MHz/(131072*2), or (I think) 95.37Hz.
*   Likewise, the highest octave `A` note is `2^5` times higher, i.e. 3051.76Hz?

## `test05g`

Next test makes some minor improvements to `test05f` and in particular [adds a test mode](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/9c650510f251c08356d92a047b63e75fcc656db0/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05g/music.v#L15-L29) where pressing any combination of the buttons will override the default note counter and sustain a specific octave/note:

|L button|R button|Test|Frequency|
|-|-|-|-|
|Open|Open|None; play normal scale||
|Open|**Pressed**|Octave 3, Note 0 (A) |`25MHz/512/32/2` => ~763Hz |
|**Pressed**|Open|Octave 4, Note 0 (A) | ~1526Hz |
|**Pressed**|**Pressed**|Octave 5, Note 0 (A) | ~3052Hz |

The way I implemented the test mode override -- while still keeping the underlying `divide_by_12` note scale counter -- looks a bit messy, but is evidently *a* correct way to do it without resorting to an extra `reg`:
*   `divide_by_12` module represents hardware that is always there.
*   It wants to put a result on wires all the time, so we give it `default_octave` and `default_note`.
*   Our main wires for `octave` and `note` are always assigned using a mux approach, represented here using ternary operators. Thus they can select from either preset values, or from `default_octave` and `default_note` depending on `testmode` (which is controlled via the pushbuttons).

As it turns out, if a `reg` were used in this construct with an `always` block it wouldn't necessarily actually synthesize to a register, because I think it can work out that direct wiring would be possible:
*   Notice how [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15128627) the author asserts that the given code examples are equivalent, and therefore that the `reg` might in fact just be treated as a wire anyway?? I guess this is because of the `always @*` making the reg sensitive to (and hence constantly changed by) the state of signals `a` and `c`, rather than being (say) clocked... in other words, I don't think it actually has a saved state.

Here are some references:
*   Using `reg` instead of `wire` and then putting the `case` in an `always` block [will not infer a flip-flop](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50766295/using-verilog-case-statement-with-continuous-assignment#comment88540643_50766295)?
*   It could be done using a `case` if the [`case` is changed into a `function`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50767898) but this doesn't necessarily make us any better off, because we still need the module instantiated somewhere.
*   Is it possible instead to use `if` or `case` with single, consistent assignments, like [this](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs270/270lab/270_docs/Advanced_Verilog.pdf#page=2)? Maybe that, again, can only be done when using a `reg` and `aways` block; see the [next slide](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs270/270lab/270_docs/Advanced_Verilog.pdf#page=3), in particular:
    > All data types in always blocks must be
    > declared as a ‘reg’ type.
    > 
    > This is required *even if the data type is for
    > **combinational** logic.*

## `Fit` bug

I was getting an error along the lines of this: https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/CPLDs-Archived/FIT-fails-with-no-error-reported/td-p/70945
*   This happened after I had successfully synthesized the design, but warnings clued me in to some errors in the code.
*   I fixed the errors, and it was when trying to synthesize again that it was coming up with "`Process "Fit" failed`".
*   I did notice that the HTML report was a couple of hours out of date; this might be the reason for the error.
*   I haven't worked out why sometimes the files don't properly rebuild. Maybe it's better to temporarily transfer all the project files into the VM and cross-manage with GitHub.
*   Instead, for now, I've: (a) shut down both VMs; (b) deleted the entire `working` directory; (c) started both VMs back up again.

The steps above didn't fix the problem. This is what I was seeing in the Console window of ISE:

```
Started : "Fit".

I tried running the same command via the shell ...

```bash

```

...and it segfaulted:

```

```

The suggestion [here](https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/CPLDs-Archived/FIT-fails-with-no-error-reported/m-p/71054/highlight/true#M1528) is to change the report format from `Source` to `ABEL`. To do this we:
1.  Right-click the "Fit" process;
2.  Select "Process Properties...";
3.  Choose the "Reports" tab;
4.  Change `-ofmt` option to `ABEL`;
5.  Hit "OK".

Then re-run the process, and it worked for me this time. It then runs these commands as part of the "Fit" process:

```bash
# Generate Post-Fit Timing Data
tsim -intstyle ise test05f test05f.nga

# Generate Timing
taengine -intstyle ise -f test05f -w --format html1 -l test05f_html/tim/timing_report.htm
```

## Notes

*   Check out ["Reference Designer's" Verilog tutorial](http://www.referencedesigner.com/tutorials/verilog/verilog_01.php)
*   Interesting: Some Verilog operators can be used in a unary mode, e.g. to XOR each bit of a vector together in one statement, as per: https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/35100
*   Check out: [Intro to Verilog PPT](http://web.mit.edu/6.111/www/f2017/handouts/L03.pdf)
*   Good stuff in [NANDLAND tutorials](https://www.nandland.com/articles/fpga-101-fpgas-for-beginners.html) such as: https://www.nandland.com/verilog/examples/example-function-verilog.html
*   Blocking and non-blocking assignment is somewhat different from what I expected. See: [this](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs270/270lab/270_docs/Advanced_Verilog.pdf#page=5)
*   Would be a good idea to study [this](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs270/270lab/270_docs/Advanced_Verilog.pdf) in full.
*   Good info about misuse of procedural continuous assignment, with solutions: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23687699
*   Older discussion that might be useful: http://web.archive.org/web/20180122214912/https://www.edaboard.com/thread248844.html
*   [`generate` blocks](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20185504) seem like a good way to effectively "metaprogram" multiple instantiations of modules and other hardware, e.g. for when needing to use a module across all bits of a vector.

## Next stuff to try

*   Use `z` values.
*   Based on [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15128627), try some sort of test with a `reg` that is sensitive to everything, and see if it actually synthesizes to different logic than my existing combinations of wires.
*   Likewise, try [this](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/304378), which probably still requires a `reg` target.
*   Read [important stuff](https://www.nandland.com/vhdl/tutorials/tutorial-process-part2.html) about sequential logic.
