## Accomplishments

*   Add a 5th harden_test combo: PL_TARGET_DENSITY=0.65, clock is 25MHz.
*   Made harden_test able to run selective combos:
    *   Combos are named 4x2:1 8x2:1 4x2:2, etc.
    *   With no argument, it will run them all (but beware: it clears out all other `?x?-combo-?.txt` files)
    *   Otherwise, the argument is an 'egrep'-compatible regular expression. If it matches any of the combo names, it will run that combo and skip the rest.
    *   Examples:
        *   `./harden_test.sh` -- do all 10.
        *   `./harden_test.sh 4x2:5` -- do just that one.
        *   `./harden_test.sh .x2:[3-5]` -- run combos 3, 4, and 5 in both 4x2 and 8x2 sizes.
*   I tried disabling the `tex` logic. It made almost no difference to area (though interestingly there was *some* difference). My hypothesis was that `tex` and the chain leading to it would be optimised out anyway because it's not actually used.

## Next steps

Run harden_test after each of these changes.

*   Make rcp_in a register instead of mux.
*   Cut back states.
*   Try combining `TraceStep` and `TraceTest`.
*   Reduce vector ranges. This could be tricky because we'll be working with mixing different sizes.
    *   Either that or just make sure the bits we don't care about are set to 0: Optimiser could work out the rest. Don't forget sign bit! Sign-extend instead of 0.

Other:

*   Run on FPGA
