# Raybox

*   Started `q16d16` branch for trying out Q16.16 fixed-point.
*   Consider how this design, as a chip, should be controlled by a CPU.
    These parts would probably be part of the CPU, but **could** be optionally
    augmented by the chip too (esp. where there are common resources):
    *   Motion
    *   Collisions/deflections
    *   Actual position/directional vectors
    *   Sound
    *   Map data
*   Consider how to render other overlays or interstitials, inc. rectangles, triangles, bitmaps, text.
*   Keep an eye out for specific instances where we can use/mix different fixed-point
    precisions and bit depths/balances. For instance, we know the `heightScaler` shouldn't
    ever get to (say) 32.0, and it really only needs 8 bits of fractional precision (for now)?

# Notes

*   VGA DAC
*   Try build with Caravel
*   Ask group the best way to do ring memory for Raybox:
    *   8~10 bits for height (height of 1024 is 425% scaling)
    *   1 bit for side
    *   Optionally 1~4 bits for texture.
    *   Min: 640x9 bits = 5760
    *   Max: 640x15 bits= 9600
    *   All groups of 9~15 bits can shift forward from a common clock
    *   Better to use a simple Verilog array/chain/generator, or a macro generated by something?
