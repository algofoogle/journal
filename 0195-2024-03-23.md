# Coming back to life

It's been a very busy start to the year, so I've done very few journal updates (though I've still been busy).

## General stuff

*   I got a job with Efabless! I start on April 8th. Lots of handover that I want/need to complete in my former role.
*   TT03p5 live demo went well. I've since ordered a board and an extra chip.
*   TT03 will hopefully arrive in the next few weeks.
*   I did a popular YouTube video on TT02, then a few days ago: one on my raybox-zero presentation that I'd given to people in the Zero to ASIC weekly meeting a while back (October 2023?)

## I built a new MPW9 VM (anton_mpw9)

### High-level

*   Specific details are in my more private notes under the "REBOOT" section.
*   Used Ubuntu Desktop 22.04. I made sure "3D acceleration" was turned on, plus EFI, before the first boot of the VM (as [I had read](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1426963/ubuntu-22-04-22-10-on-virtual-machine-is-extremely-slow-same-behaviour-on-vmw) this could make a difference to how Ubuntu sets itself up).
*   Also configured video memory to be 256MB, and I'm using 8GB of VM RAM for now, with 8 vCPUs.
*   Used Matt Venn's guide for manual installation of OpenLane and all the other standard ASIC digital tools. I took snapshots along the way. I also installed VSCode.
*   Set video scaling to 200% hoping it would mean a smaller (FHD vs UHD) framebuffer when run on 4K monitors.
*   Graphics controller is "VMSVGA" (VMware emulation, apparently; can check in the logs how this is going).
*   NOTE: Network is using NAT.

### Tests and transfer

*   After getting the VM going it seemed that doing the standard "make user_proj_example" takes over 24 minutes, with 10mins of that just on the Magic DRC step. That seems excessive. I couldn't find a way to improve this.
*   This was originally on a L5, so I then transferred the VM to my L7.
*   I had VBox 7.0.10 but updated to 7.0.14. Need to remember to update Guest Additions.
*   Added a host shared folder: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents` didn't work so I needed it fully-qualified. Mapped as `HOST_Documents`.
*   I noticed "Enable Nested VT-x/AMD-V" from the L5 remained on (which I've not been able to use on my L7 for some reason) but after turning it off and saving the VM settings, it won't let me turn it back on now. Not sure it would've worked anyway (given prior findings).

### Boot...

*   Booted OK, but I saw some console-level warnings or something, maybe about GFX, before the boot logo appeared.
*   Mouse cursor is not visible on Ubuntu desktop, but is visible on its LHS menu. Also, mouse clicks are not working. Actually, LEFT clicks are not working... RIGHT are?? Actually that may have been because I was too eager with hitting ESC and F1 during boot.
*   In the VBox status bar, I see an icon of a turtle with a "V" on its back where it represents CPUs. Hovering over it shows "Execution engine: native API" instead of "VT-x/AMD-V"
*   OK, it seems I need to look into this: https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=99390 -- I'll come back to that.
*   glxgears runs fine on my 2560x1440 display (over HDMI). Approx 70fps.
*   **I have noticed however** that VSCode (in my `journal`) IS slow... takes a while to interpret Markdown syntax highlighting, and shows latency to mouse/keyboard.
*   FWIW: Notepad on Windows (at least on my 4K monitor) even feels like it has latency!

### TODO

*   Try measures to force out Hyper-V (and hence reactivate "VT-x/AMD-V"): https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=99390
*   Update VirtualBox Guest Additions
*   Check for other journal entries about VM performance. [0170](./0170-2023-10-31.md) is one.
*   Check my new anton_mpw9 VM OpenLane performance against ztoa_mpw9 for both sky130 and gf180. Monitor GPU0/1 performance.
