NOTE: The prior journal entry [0166](./0166-2023-10-26.md), even though dated 2023-10-26, was started on the same date as THIS entry (2023-10-27). 0166 was a bit more rambling with loose notes. This one is a LITTLE better. I expect 0168 will wrap it all up properly.

# Next steps

*   Try snippet in CUP/UPW, which will hopefully test both:
    *   Re-hardening `top_ew_algofoogle`
    *   Making sure my instantiation of the macro in UPW is OK
*   Check the full Caravel GDS carefully. Maybe also check the macro's GDS too
*   FIGURE OUT THE POLARITY OF `la_oenb` AND `io_oeb`
    *   From what I've [learned so far](#figuring-out-la-direction), a 0 bit in `la_oenb` means "this is an SoC OUTPUT, being sent to `la_data_in`"
    *   Might need to test it with dv-TB or cocotb.
*   Implement `la_oenb` sense for reset safety, and maybe also use 1 more for masking out all other inputs that depend on LAs (e.g. so that a floating state can't screw up SPI, and maybe forces ON the debug stuff).
*   Try and do a full test/sim with cocotb?
*   If it turns out to be bad to do the mapping/constants that I'm doing in UPW, then maybe we can just instantiate an extra mapping/switching macro. I assume this is how Matt would've done muxing, anyway.
*   Repeat hardening in newer CUP/caravel. **Find out what Ellen and Pawel are using.**
*   How might I use a total of 4 full-time inputs? Maybe the 4th can select between SPI textures and bitwise textures.
*   ESD protection for analog: Seems to be built-in to the pads even when using analog. See [this](https://web.open-source-silicon.dev/t/14135562/u017x0nm2e7-i-see-digital-io-mprj-io-pins-are-0-to-37-index-) and search for ESD.
*   This is important to know: [setting `io_oeb[*]` for analog pins](https://web.open-source-silicon.dev/t/14135562/u017x0nm2e7-i-see-digital-io-mprj-io-pins-are-0-to-37-index-#da76de78-afe4-46a4-9daa-ffd132122d6d):
    >   On a caravel frame, the `user_project_wrapper` pins `analog_io[28:0]` will connect to the corresponding gpio cells for the digital `io_out[35:7]` cells. For any cells used for analog I/O, I recommend you set the corresponding digital `io_oeb[*]` signal to high, although this might not be necessary depending on your `verilog/rtl/user_defines.v` settings.


# Testing my macro in CUP (caravel_user_project)

NOTE: This is an older version of caravel_user_project (i.e. [`mpw-8c`](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project/tree/mpw-8c)). Need to try with a newer version too. **Find out what Ellen and Pawel are using.**

## Prep clean CUP

1.  Using desktop PC's MPW8 VM
1.  Go into `~/asic_tools`
1.  Archive old work on `caravel_user_project/`:
    *   Rename to `CUP-wrapped-group-test-2023-04-04` -- looks like it was me adapting solo_squash_caravel to the wrapped group submission (which never went ahead because of abandoned Google OpenMPW shuttles).
    *   Compress old CUPs (currently ~6GB each):
        ```bash
        tar cjf CUP-Progress-backup-2023-03-28.tar.bz2 CUP-Progress-backup-2023-03-28 && rm -rf CUP-Progress-backup-2023-03-28
        tar cjf CUP-wrapped-group-test-2023-04-04.tar.bz2 CUP-wrapped-group-test-2023-04-04 && rm -rf CUP-wrapped-group-test-2023-04-04
        ```
1.  Extract clean CUP copy: `tar xjf MPW8-Clean-caravel_user_project.tar.bz2` (5.8GB)
1.  Rename it: `mv caravel_user_project CUP-0167-EW-raybox-zero`
1.  NOTE: `~/CUP` is a symlink to `~/asic_tools/caravel_user_project`, let's make `caravel_user_project` itself a symlink to `CUP-0167-EW-raybox-zero`:
    ```bash
    cd ~/asic_tools
    ln -s CUP-0167-EW-raybox-zero caravel_user_project
    ```
1.  ```bash
    cd ~/CUP && realpath .
    # /home/zerotoasic/asic_tools/CUP-0167-EW-raybox-zero
    ```

## Run CUP example project test

Don't worry: We'll use this same CUP to integrate raybox-zero after doing these example project tests.

1.  ```bash
    cd verilog/dv/io_ports   # 'io_ports' is one of the example project's tests.
    make  # Run tests.
    ```
2.  OK, that seems to work.
3.  ```bash
    cd ../la_test1   # Now let's try 'la_test1'
    make
    ```
4.  Works too, but very slow.

## Instantiate my design (top_ew_algofoogle)

1.  Clone raybox-zero repo, `ew` branch:
    ```bash
    cd ~/CUP/verilog/rtl
    git clone -b ew git@github.com:algofoogle/raybox-zero
    cd 
    ```
2.  Delete `user_proj_example.v` and edit `user_project_wrapper.v` to paste in the [instantiation snippet](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero/blob/ew/src/rtl/ew_caravel_snippets/SNIPPET1_NoShare.v).
3.  Edit `verilog/includes/includes.rtl.caravel_user_project` and replace the `user_proj_example.v` line with all our relevant source files. Result:
    ```
    # Caravel user project includes
    -v $(USER_PROJECT_VERILOG)/rtl/user_project_wrapper.v
    -v $(USER_PROJECT_VERILOG)/rtl/raybox-zero/src/rtl/top_ew_algofoogle.v
    -v $(USER_PROJECT_VERILOG)/rtl/raybox-zero/src/rtl/debug_overlay.v

    -v $(USER_PROJECT_VERILOG)/rtl/raybox-zero/src/rtl/spi_registers.v
    -v $(USER_PROJECT_VERILOG)/rtl/raybox-zero/src/rtl/vga_mux.v
    -v $(USER_PROJECT_VERILOG)/rtl/raybox-zero/src/rtl/vga_sync.v
    -v $(USER_PROJECT_VERILOG)/rtl/raybox-zero/src/rtl/wall_tracer.v
    ```
4.  ```bash
    cd ~/CUP/verilog/dv
    mkdir test_rbzero_snippet1
    ```

# Figuring out LA direction

*   SoC drives `la_oenb` (it's an SoC output, design input).
*   Here's an example snippet from the mpw-8c version of caravel_user_project:
    ```verilog
    assign la_write = ~la_oenb[63:32] & ~{BITS{valid}};
    // Assuming LA probes [65:64] are for controlling the count clk & reset  
    assign clk = (~la_oenb[64]) ? la_data_in[64]: wb_clk_i;
    assign rst = (~la_oenb[65]) ? la_data_in[65]: wb_rst_i;
    ```
*   The example shows that for `clk` and `rst`, when a bit in `la_oenb` is LOW (0), the corresponding `la_data_in` is valid. Hence, 0 must mean "Output from SoC to design".
*   Thus, if any `la_oenb` bit is HIGH (1), then `la_data_in` must be Hi-Z (floating), and the SoC is ready to read it as an input from our design instead (i.e. our design should assert `la_data_out`).
*   In the `la_write` case, any given bit in that is 1 when `la_oenb` is LOW (0=Output from SoC, input to design) and `valid` is 0 (i.e. NOT a valid WB write?? I dunno). In THAT case, if they're all 0, the counter increments. Otherwise, the counter gets set to the mask of `la_write` and `la_input`. Again this implies that a LOW on an `la_oenb` bit is data our design is RECEIVING from the SoC.
*   Thus, given our LA usage is all about inputs into our design, we should want all corresponding `la_oenb` bits to be 0. For any that are not, the input is not being driven, so we must take a default.
*   The thing that makes this extra confusing is that with VexRiscv, the `reg_la*_oenb` registers expect POSITIVE polarity in order to enable VexRiscv=>Design outputs, i.e. [setting a bit in that register to ***1*** enables it as an output from the SoC, to the design](https://github.com/algofoogle/solo-squash-caravel/blob/eb307e157a5c043a4b062cf4ca89ae93e8352a8e/verilog/dv/solo_squash_caravel/solo_squash_caravel.c#L114-L116).
*   Matt has [confirmed](https://discord.com/channels/778248761054986292/939534075595739156/1167403384232476692) my assumptions, which are as follows:
    *   If you set a bit to 1 in `reg_la*_oenb` via firmware, it gets inverted and becomes a 0 in `la_oenb` as received by the design hardware.
    *   This indicates that the respective `la_data_input` is valid, and is providing a value as an input to the design (i.e. an output from the Management SoC).
    *   You can then [set/clear the corresponding bit in `reg_la*_data`](https://github.com/algofoogle/solo-squash-caravel/blob/eb307e157a5c043a4b062cf4ca89ae93e8352a8e/verilog/dv/solo_squash_caravel/solo_squash_caravel.c#L117-L118) to drive that value into the respective `la_data_input` line so the design can sense it.
*   I still need to check this, though, because even in his example screenshot, the same value is being written to `reg_la1_oenb` and `reg_la1_iena`... this implies that it's enabling the bits as inputs and outputs at the same time.
*   Matt is running [the la_test1 example](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project/blob/872a4fc82fbd96448232186858c0ed4bffc991b4/verilog/dv/la_test1/la_test1.c#L104-L109) which includes this:
    ```c
    // Configure LA probes [31:0], [127:64] as inputs to the cpu 
    // Configure LA probes [63:32] as outputs from the cpu
    reg_la0_oenb = reg_la0_iena = 0x00000000;    // [31:0]
    reg_la1_oenb = reg_la1_iena = 0xFFFFFFFF;    // [63:32]
    reg_la2_oenb = reg_la2_iena = 0x00000000;    // [95:64]
    reg_la3_oenb = reg_la3_iena = 0x00000000;    // [127:96]
    ```
    Note how it says this pattern sets `LA[63:32]` (i.e. all of `reg_la1_oenb`) to be outputs (using high bits), and sets everything else to be inputs? Additionally, `iena`==0 means "input" while `oenb`==1 "output". Oh well, whatever.
