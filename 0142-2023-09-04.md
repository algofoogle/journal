## More optimisation tests

I tried implementing a shared multiplier inside the reciprocal, but it generally made things worse, so I'm going to abandon that for now.

It *might* work out OK if we merge it with the other shared multiplier (from test005), but I think this will make things look pretty ugly so I'll try that much later, if at all.

Findings:

## Accomplishments

*   For raybox-zero, I merged `test005-shmul` into `main`. This includes the changes made in shared_rcp, test001, test002, and test005.
*   For tt04-raybox-zero I then merged in its own `shared_rcp` branch (mostly just improvements to `harden_test.sh`) and updated it to use the latest raybox-zero@main as above. I also modified `info.yaml` to use a 4x2 tile size, and kept it otherwise at the defaults. Its GHA harden might fail because I need to still update `config.tcl` to use a 25MHz target instead of 50MHz (since test005 can only get up to ~44MHz).

## Summary of old branches

For each test that led to an improvement, I built on it with the next test. I abandoned some and went back to earlier tests if the experiment didn't lead to an overall improvement.

This is the tree of branches that came off raybox-zero@main:
*   [shared_rcp]: Implementing sharing of a single `reciprocal` instance for: rayDirX, rayDirY, and vdist.
    *   [test001-notex-notracetest]: Comment out code that determines `tex` (as it's not used yet) and merge `TraceStep` and `TraceTest` states.
        *   [test002-vdistreg]: Store `visualWallDist` as a register so we don't need to deduct from it when tracing is done.
            *   **(ABANDONED)**: [test003-noreset-cullstates]: Experimented with removing excessive states and disabled explicit reset logic. Didn't seem to make any real difference.
                *   **(ABANDONED)**: [test004-sdynoreg]: Try stepDistY with no register (instead using reciprocal output directly). Wasn't better.
            *   **[test005-shmul]**: Replace wall_tracer's two separate multipliers (for trackInit) with one shared multiplier. **This was then merged back into `main` because it offered good improvements overall.**
                *   **(ABANDONED)**: [test006-shmulreg]: shared multiplier with registered inputs instead of mux. Generally worse.
                *   **(REVISIT)**: [test007-regrcpin]: use registered rcp_in instead of mux. Marginally more area than test005, but **faster**. **All hardens complete successfully.**
                *   **(ABANDONED)**: [test008-rcp2]: Clunky 2-step rcp with internal shmul, plus trying to improve rcp control. Surprisingly worse.
                

## Next steps

*   Try using `tex` -- shared multiplier? Implement actual texture rendering.
    *   Do it on both the latest/greatest test00X branch and on original shared_rcp branch.
*   Smaller view vectors. Maybe just try truncating what we feed into wall_tracer, reciprocal, etc, then try formally reducing the size of our floating-point definitions.
*   Actively ditch rcp's sat and abs logic? Do we actually need the sign bit for rcp?
*   Check warnings.

## Later

*   Try building a full state machine for all multiplies/reciprocals.
*   Test on FPGA
*   See what LZC24 actually synthesises to
*   IRQs
*   Reciprocal using LUT instead of big multiplies, or an iterative (Newton Raphson) implementation?
*   Find out if a combination of ALL abandoned optimisations actually turns out to be better.
*   Bring back overlays
*   Design for different resolutions/timings

## Stuff good for demo

*   Mode pin to switch between simple directional controls and SPI control.
*   Optional rotation engine; matrix transform of vectors, or generate vectors directly from angle?

## Notes

*   Can't run `./tt/tt_tool.py --harden` without it being in a valid git repo.
