# Pygame-based `raybox-bridge.py`

The source is here: [`raybox-bridge.py`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/master/pi_pico/pico-de0/client/raybox-bridge.py).

For now it just aims to prove that, on a Windows host, we can use Python to get raw keyboard and mouse
data so that it could be sent on to my Pico-DE0, and hence could control my Raybox design.

My first actual DE0-Nano Verilog experiment using this should perhaps be to implement a mouse cursor in a simple VGA display.
