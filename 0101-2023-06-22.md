# Notes

For TT04's GitHub Actions, I took the general code of [my PR for GDS-to-PNG conversion](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt03p5-submission-template/pull/4) and [adapted it](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt-gds-action/pull/1).

This includes using `pngquant --quality 10-30 ...` which reduces the total colours in the image, especially
for larger images, but should hopefully achieve the target of 8x2-sized tiles rendering to PNGs at full
resolution but under 5MB.

Later I want to look at whether this method can be moved from discrete GHA steps to `tt_tool.py --create-png`.


# Pygame-based `raybox-bridge.py`

The source is here: [`raybox-bridge.py`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/master/pi_pico/pico-de0/client/raybox-bridge.py).

For now it just aims to prove that, on a Windows host, we can use Python to get raw keyboard and mouse
data so that it *could* be sent on to my Pico-DE0, and hence could control my Raybox design.

My first actual DE0-Nano Verilog experiment using this should perhaps be to implement a mouse cursor in a simple VGA display.
