*   Info about [Xilinx FPGA history](https://studylib.net/doc/5536163/xilinx-fpgas-evolution-and-revolution) inc. the XC2018 and XC3030 that I have [in my shed catalogue](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HI4eJYbuCxAVp2JpSBoTsyrWX5-2k51zn9CEyu4LmDQ/edit#gid=1&range=419:420).
*   Also some possible Xilinx info about [old development tools and procedures](https://www.xilinx.com/txpatches/pub/documentation/xactstep6/dsuser.pdf).

## `test05i`

### Optimisation/Fitting

*   Initially just a copy of `test05h`. Doesn't "Fit", as `test05h` didn't before I changed it to "Density" optimisation in the Fit stage.
*   I tried first just changing the existing XST (Synthesis) speed-based optimisation from "Normal" to "High". This may have made it worse, requiring 51 equations instead of 50 equations.
*   I changed it to "Goal: Area; Effort: Normal". This didn't work either. The text report shows what failed to map:
    ```
    *************************  Summary of UnMapped Logic  ************************

    ```
    ...I think Speed/High mode failed to map 6 signals? I do wonder whether rearranging the logic could push for a better result, since I don't know that we need speed and timing precision for this design.
*   Changing to "Area/High" still doesn't help so I changed back to "Speed/Normal". I then tried the "Exhaustive Fit Mode" (see [here](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp444.pdf#page=3) for more info).
    *   It can be seen that this iteratively runs `cpldfit` with different "Collapsing Input Limit" and "Collapsing Product Term Limit" combinations, hoping to find one that succeeds
    *   It is relatively fast for each try, with such a small design, but we could still be looking at something on the order of over 2,000 iterations, with each taking a second or more in my VM.
*   As it happens, Exhaustive Fit Mode *did* manage to find a solution after only a few minutes, which it determined with these parameters:
    ```
    INFO:Cpld:994 - Exhaustive fitting is trying pterm limit: 22 and input limit: 54
    ```
    ...and these overall stats:

### Adapting MusicBox4 tutorial code

So [MusicBox4](https://www.fpga4fun.com/MusicBox4.html) *might* be a little wrong...? The ROM code is only included in [this link](https://www.fpga4fun.com/files/music.zip) at the bottom of the page, and the *rest* of the code in that archive is different from what the page recommends we change.

Hence, I adapted what was in the actual archive to fit with the code I have in `test05i` (copied from `test05h`).

This produced a design that wouldn't initially fit, even with 'Density' optimisation. I let it run with Exhaustive Fitting, and it did take a long time. I'm not sure how long but according to timestamps on various files it took 3 hours and 7 minutes.

The solution was:

```
INFO:Cpld:994 - Exhaustive fitting is trying pterm limit: 14 and input limit: 15
```

...with these results:

```

```

Anyway, these were the specific changes I made from the base `test05h` code to produce [`test05i`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/tree/master/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05i):
*   Moved [`divide_by_12` module](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blame/eca62991e2ee14f46362aeb42466084257696299/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05i/music.v#L99-L135) into main `music.v` code.
*   Added the [inline melody ROM](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blame/eca62991e2ee14f46362aeb42466084257696299/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05i/music.v#L138-L153), but I also changed the tail end of it from the original:
    ```verilog
        240: note<= 8'd25;
        241: note<= 8'd0;
        242: note<= 8'd00;
        default: note <= 8'd0;
    endcase
    ```
    ...to now alternate the last few notes rapidly between notes 2 octaves apart:
    ```verilog
        240: note<= 25;
        241: note<= 60;
        242: note<= 36;
        243: note<= 60;
        244: note<= 36;
        245: note<= 60;
        246: note<= 36;
        247: note<= 60;
        248: note<= 36;
        249: note<= 60;
        250: note<= 36;
    default: note <= 0;
    endcase
    ```
    NOTE: This change breaks the fitting step, again. For more info, see below.
*   Added the instance of `music_ROM` to [read notes into `fullnote`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blame/eca62991e2ee14f46362aeb42466084257696299/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05i/music.v#L14).
*   Extended main `tone` counter from 28 bits to [30 bits](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blame/eca62991e2ee14f46362aeb42466084257696299/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05i/music.v#L7-L8), because now instead of counting the 64 notes (upper 6 bits) to play in a scale, we are counting 256 note addresses (upper 8 bits) to retrieve from the inline ROM.
*   Simplified `counter_octave` to [use a bit shift](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blame/eca62991e2ee14f46362aeb42466084257696299/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05i/music.v#L83) instead of hardcoded constants.
*   Added [`fullnote!=0` check](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blame/eca62991e2ee14f46362aeb42466084257696299/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05i/music.v#L91) check; if the note is `0`, the speaker is silent.
*   Where `tone[21:0]` counts the duration of each note (2<sup>22</sup> cycles at 50MHz, or ~168ms), we check for when the top 4 bits are `0000`, and [silence the speaker during that time](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blame/eca62991e2ee14f46362aeb42466084257696299/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05i/music.v#L92), which basically means the first ~10ms of each note is silent, to sound like a tiny gap.

Anyway, the melody it plays is "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer". It's the whole song, except for the last few notes, which were left out of the ROM for some reason.

Note that when I made the change to the end of the ROM, as described in one of the steps above, it broke the fitting step again, so I'm running it overnight with the most strict settings I can... though it's possible my XST change for "Area/High" will trip me up; I'm not sure. It's also possible the design simply won't fit as-is, in which case I might consider taking the [50MHz-to-25MHz clock halver](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/eca62991e2ee14f46362aeb42466084257696299/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05i/test05i.v#L12) and breaking it down to maybe 12.5MHz or even 6.25MHz. This will add 2 more bits to `reg clk25`, but hence probably save us 4 bits in total, between [`tone`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/eca62991e2ee14f46362aeb42466084257696299/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05i/music.v#L8) and [`counter_note`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/eca62991e2ee14f46362aeb42466084257696299/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05i/music.v#L77) (and don't forget to match [`div`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/eca62991e2ee14f46362aeb42466084257696299/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05i/music.v#L50-L66)).

There is [one other line](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/eca62991e2ee14f46362aeb42466084257696299/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05i/music.v#L83) I think I could change, though I'm not sure if it would make much difference. It could be this, perhaps?

```verilog
  always @(posedge clk) if (counter_note==0 && octave!=0) counter_octave <= counter_octave==0 ? 5'b11111 >> octave : counter_octave-1;
```

...i.e. don't constantly assign `0` back into `counter_octave`.

I ended up [changing the code to use a 6.25MHz clock](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/commit/c3895f1967a876765a3a99a0cd3971d2a97f356e#diff-e0d7274c981ac306b8e0cb01ca51e2f6) (by dividing 50MHz by 8), so I was able to save on some repeated counter bits in `music`, and this made the fitting work on the first try. I also [put the last line of the song in](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/commit/660517cb6bb67f2b4b88da2f3962827bcee654f0#diff-e0d7274c981ac306b8e0cb01ca51e2f6), but had to trim the last note to allow a gap of silence before it loops back to the start.


## Notes

*   I should learn more about [Parameterized Modules](http://www.mrc.uidaho.edu/mrc/people/jff/EO_440/Handouts/SystemVerilog%20and%20Modeling/SV%20Parameterized%20Modules.pdf) which allow us to do things like define a module with a variable number of bits (i.e. variable vector size). See also: [this](http://www.asic-world.com/verilog/para_modules1.html#:~:text=2001) and [this](https://www.chipverify.com/verilog/verilog-parameters).
