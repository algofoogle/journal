# raybox-zero

*   Added keyboard/mouse view control into sim, per Raybox.
*   Default is typical mouse left/right (as though view is rated), but <kbd>O</kbd> key toggles mouse X/Y axis swapping, so that mouse up/down controls what appears to be the up/down view orientation. When in this mode, strafing isn't as expected -- how would  you represent drifting up/down vs. forwards/backwards anyway? Maybe up/down are elevation, and space/CTRL are advance/retreat?
*   Motion speed in sim should be based on real time, but is currently just based on frame.
