# raybox-zero sim keyboard/mouse control and partial POV SPI synth success

## Accomplishments

*   Added keyboard/mouse view control into sim, per Raybox.
*   Default is typical mouse left/right (as though view is rated), but <kbd>o</kbd> (orientation) key toggles mouse X/Y axis swapping, so that mouse up/down controls what appears to be the up/down view orientation. When in this mode, strafing isn't as expected -- how would  you represent drifting up/down vs. forwards/backwards anyway? Maybe up/down are elevation, and space/CTRL are advance/retreat?
*   Motion speed in sim should be based on real time, but is currently just based on frame.
*   Fixed an issue with multiple drivers on internal `pov.ready` signal: https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero/commit/a26525aca430deb3163502bb46c3d6f5b9024e07
    *   NOTE: This showed up as a synth error in OpenLane step 1, and that at least made sense because of [this](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero/blob/5b5633cc4980e2a4b44801ea91f6565c4c3969d7/src/rtl/pov.v#L29) competing with [this](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero/blob/5b5633cc4980e2a4b44801ea91f6565c4c3969d7/src/rtl/pov.v#L86), HOWEVER...
    *   ...even after I put the latter one within `if (!reset)`, I was still getting the same error.
    *   Strangely, though, I wasn't always getting it... I think maybe the SYNTH_STRATEGY was leading to differing results.
    *   In any case, reworking per the commit above seemed to make the error go away.
    *   See [below](#initial-pov-spi-attempt-raybox-zero-cc01526) for the multiple drivers error.

Summary:

*   ~18.7k cells reduces to ~8k

### Initial POV SPI attempt: [raybox-zero `cc01526`](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero/blob/cc01526666dbe07e1b2fde5dccecbd6657350e37/src/rtl/pov.v)

Summary:
*   Only 8x2 fits so far.
*   Combo 4 (TT04 OpenLane with default SYNTH_STRATEGY and 50MHz clock) is notably smaller than combos 1 and 2!
*   ~30k cells reduces to ~13k with combo 4.
*   Combo 1, 8x2, **success** at 25MHz.
*   Combo 2, 8x2, **completes** with setup violations at 50MHz.
*   Combo 3, 8x2, **crash** as above with SIGABRT.
*   Combo 4, 8x2, **completes** with setup violations at 50MHz.

Note also:
*   **WARNING**: 8x2 combo 4 had antenna violations??
    *   From `--full-summary` (metrics.csv):
        ```
        pin_antenna_violations : 7
        net_antenna_violations : 7
        ```
    *   Worst was 675 versus 400 target. Many were still in the 400s, though.
    *   This is the list from `runs/wokwi/reports/signoff/40-antenna_violators.rpt`:

*   Other oddities:
    *   `1-synthesis.errors`: `ABC: Error: The network is combinational.` -- supposedly can be ignored.
    *   `1-synthesis.warnings`: `ABC: Warning: Detected 2 multi-output gates (for example, "sky130_fd_sc_hd__fa_1").` -- ??
    *   `2-sta.warnings`: `Warning: There are 16 unconstrained endpoints.`

## Next steps

*   Fix synth warnings inc. `$rtoi` stuff.
*   Reciprocal sharing. Thoughts:
    *   If we were to get away with exactly 1 reciprocal, we need to work out the range of its possible inputs and outputs.
    *   e.g. truncating 'facing' vector is definitely likely and would be effective, and *so far* the only other reciprocal
        is the height_scaler which also only uses bits `2:-8`.
    *   FSM update might look like this:
        ```verilog
        //SMELL: Ideally we want this shared_reciprocal to be outside of wall_tracer, so it doesn't 'belong'
        // to any one module. If we do that, how do we control registered access to it? Or do we use a mux instead?
        // I'd rather not have to tristate it, but maybe that would be needed...?
        reg `F rcp_in, rcp_out;
        wire rcp_sat;
        wire rcp_abs = 1'b1; //SMELL: ??
        reciprocal #(.M(`Qm),.N(`Qn)) shared_reciprocal (.i_data(rcp_in), .i_abs(rcp_abs), .o_data(rcp_out), .o_sat(rcp_sat));
        ...
        reg `F stepDistX, stepDistY;
        ...
        // Add new states between PREP and STEP, or blend them at the edges...
        RCPX1: begin
            rcp_in <= rayDirX;
            state <= RCPX2;
        end
        RCPX2: begin
            // This state is just here to give the reciprocal's large combo logic time to settle.
            state <= RCPX3;
        end
        RCPX3: begin
            //SMELL: This state is probably not necessary to keep separate from RCPY1,
            // but I'm just considering it now because we have plenty of time and this might
            // help avoid both setup and hold violations.
            stepDistX <= rcp_out;
            state <= RCPY1;
        end
        RCPY1: begin
            rcp_in <= rayDirY;
            ...
        ```
    *   NOTE: Power consumption should reduce because the reciprocal won't be frequently changeable now via SPI/POV.
*   Sim could do with a view rotate option. Is there a cheating way we could just rotate the whole canvas without having to change the X/Y code?

## Notes

*   Is it better to have `rcp_in` as a register, or driven by a mux?
