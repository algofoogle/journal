`test08b` tries to implement a "pretty" pong. As it happens, I couldn't get the ball logic into XC9572XL, even with all the frills turned off.

Next steps (maybe for `test08c`):

*   Try to replicate simplicity of fpga4fun pong; it uses "wrong" timing that makes the logic simpler.
*   Try using lower resolution
*   Defining Xilinx GCK (global clocks) in Verilog is weird: [Do it with a comment](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/help/iseguide/mergedProjects/destech/html/ca_cpld_attributes.htm#:~:text=XST%20Verilog%20Attributes) in the code. I did it [here](...). XST sees this:
    *   In "HDL Analysis": `Set user-defined property "BUFG =  CLK" for signal <clk25>.`
    *   In "Low Level Synthesis": `implementation constraint: BUFG=CLK	 : clk25`
*   Implement "swing" drift on the background.

`test08c` does work with different timing, and the TFT monitor I'm using can sync to it OK.
