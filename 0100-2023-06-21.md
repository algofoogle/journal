# What next?

*   **Now:**
    *   Pygame for KB/mouse capture and sending data to Pico-DE0.
    *   Pico-DE0 speed, or at least prove that compact commands can work instead.
    *   If those don't work out, do SDL version instead: Figure out Windows USB-serial in C.
*   **Soon:**
    *   Prep Raybox to support state loading via buffered registers.
*   **Later:**
    *   Optimise Raybox via FSM: Cut some frame lines to make extra tracing time,
        and put in shared resources (i.e. share the reciprocal).
    *   Make it modular; optional sprite/texture stuff to be able to slim down the design
        if needed for TT or an MPW.
    *   Run caster FSM at 50MHz, rest of display rendering and memory access at 25MHz.
    *   Is there a way to pipeline the reciprocal so it can get to a result without
        having to cascade its combo logic too far?
    *   Try OpenRAM for memory that MUST be inside the design.
    *   Work on external RAM access.

# Notes

*   https://pypi.org/project/WinUsbCDC/
*   https://github.com/pyusb/pyusb -- No new releases since 2021, but its GitHub repo
    has some updates from 2022 (plus minor stuff in 2023).
*   Is CircuitPython's [usb_cdc](https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/shared-bindings/usb_cdc/index.html)
    for the embedded device, or the host PC?
*   Try setting up separate SSH configs (inc. user per repo):
