## Measurebox

I'm working on my "Measurebox" which can be 3D printed and then placed on my flatbed scanner to provide a means to measure precise dimensions of something.

The model so far is [Measurebox.blend](/files/0016/Measurebox.blend), which I've also exported as [Measurebox.stl](/files/0016/Measurebox.stl).

Here are my ideas for what comes next:

*   Put on measurement marks, with large centimetre ticks and small millimetre ticks. Do we need half-millimetres? Possibly not, because if we get DPI right, then we can use precise pixel measurements (where at 600dpi, 1 pixel = 0.042333mm).
*   Likewise, we can mark that the 200mm limit is 4724.4 pixels at 600dpi.
*   What should the tick marks be? Simple lines that are (say) 0.2mm wide? V-grooves? Arrows that narrow to a point? It depends on the accuracy of the 3D printer and whether it's better to measure from the middle of the tick mark, or from an outer limit.
*   I've got support holes in my design with the idea being that, even though the measurebox is only 20mm tall at the moment, it could either be capped off with a flat lid or could be extended with a taller structure to house larger objects.
*   I could even design a lid that has slats in it which allow "holder" rails to be clamped in with wing nuts, to help hold objects in place. Blu-tack would probably do just fine in most cases, though.

I want to try OpenSCAD to see if it makes it easier to specify the exact dimensions and shapes I want, including procedural stuff (like the tick marks as an array/loop).

I could also try some stuff like this, in Blender, using Python?

[three.js](https://threejs.org/), like Paper.js from yesterday, looks really interestsing! It has an [editor](https://threejs.org/editor/).
