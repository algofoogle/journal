I was going to try the below method to create tapered text or curve extrusions in Blender, but it didn't work as intended. The outer edges sort of work, but inside regions (i.e. between "islands") would otherwise need a seam. There are other complications, too.

1.  Make sure original paths are clean in Illustrator.
2.  Create a second path by doing an offset. This will be used as the base.
3.  Use an outer reference shape to help with alignment later.
4.  Import both into Blender.
5.  Convert curves to meshes.
6.  Reduce geometry, e.g. Limited Dissolve (8&deg;). Maybe also before/after do degenerate clean-up and welding vertices?
7.  Extrude the offset version.
8.  Find a way to "inscribe" the original (narrower) path mesh on the extruded offset version. If necessary, use booleans, and possibly [BoolTool](https://blender-addons.org/bool-tool-addon/). See also: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/blenderhelp/comments/a3c59t/28_booltool_equivalent/), [2](https://www.blendernation.com/2014/05/14/add-on-booltool/), [3](https://github.com/jayanam/fast-carve/tree/fast-carve-2-8) (Fast Carve).
9.  Pull up the original mesh to produce the desired extrusion/taper.
10. Optionally select any "curb" edges/faces left over from point 8 and dissolve?
