# SPI Flash ROM

*   I want to make raybox-zero able to read data from a memory of some kind.
*   SPI seems most likely at the moment, due to low pin count available on TT05.
*   SPI Flash ROM is pretty standard and cheap these days. I've ordered some on eBay (W25Q32FVSIG, W25Q64BVAIG) and order some on DigiKey (W25Q40CLSNIG-ND, W25Q16JVSSIQ-ND, AT25EU0011A-SSHN-TCT-ND, GD25Q20CTIGR, W25Q32JVSFIQ).
*   I've also desoldered a BergMicro 25Q80ASSIG (8Mbit) from an ESP-01, and put it on a breakout board. This device should hopefully be able to do at least 25MHz transfers, maybe 60~120MHz, and possibly much higher with DSPI or QSPI.
*   I'm going to try using my Bus Pirate v3.5 to read it, then program it.
*   NOTE: For now I think my BP has been specially flashed with JTAG (Bus-Blaster-like) firmware, because it was hooked up to the JTAG port of my XC9572XL test board. I might need to reflash it.
*   When I plug it into my Win 11 laptop it shows up in Device Manager as an FT232 device, with a warning symbol, but after going to Properties I was able to 'update driver' and then it shows up as 'USB Serial Port (COM3)'.
*   Next step: What serial UI do we get from the BP? I'll install a terminal program, or do USB pass-thru to a Linux VM.

# Notes

*   Bus Pirate JTAG notes (and references to [Bus Pirate JTAG XSVF player](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate_JTAG_XSVF_player)) are found in [0026], [0027], and [0028].
*   Now that we've got an SPI slave implemented in raybox-zero and the FPGA, we could use the Bus Pirate to SPI stuff to it, if for some reason using PicoDeo is unsuitable.
