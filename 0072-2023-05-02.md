## Achievements

*   Map grid boundary glitch [fixed](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox/commit/59824d831c260424fecd22bf27b7558be5484a4d#diff-6d01f67865cf94af8bd81d54d8b15820694287a17dd7a0933ae0291c7c4685d5R107-R114): I was incorrectly assuming `rayDir>0` would lead to `partial`
    being in the range `[0,1)` but it's actually `(0,1]`, i.e. it needs to be able to reach 1.0
    but I didn't provide enough bits to allow a `1.0-0.0` result of `1.0`.
*   Quantified movement speed; [3 different options](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox/commit/59824d831c260424fecd22bf27b7558be5484a4d#diff-cf9903fc581724059c71a5c84e34029b00f9ba24800c39bec8d36c4e074675daR70-R80), but only the middle "walk" speed is used for now.
*   Sim:
    *   Changed [lock overrides and added momentary (one-shot) option](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox/commit/59824d831c260424fecd22bf27b7558be5484a4d#diff-2f1666fc46c35f596afa85eb039f8cbd5f9132cffdff39fbab1c5952dd393317R260-R273).
    *   Started [adding design inspection to On-Screen Display](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox/commit/59824d831c260424fecd22bf27b7558be5484a4d#diff-2f1666fc46c35f596afa85eb039f8cbd5f9132cffdff39fbab1c5952dd393317R677-R678).

## What next?

*   Need to see how lower FP precision goes when we bring in rotations of the camera. In that case,
    stepping the viewplane might not go so well, or might not need to be a clean /512 or /1024 step.
*   Put FPS counter in sim main window.
*   Add option for text in 
*   Create a model for loading the initial state of the "game" into the design, e.g.
    player position and direction, movement speed, and maybe more dynamic parameters later.
    Can we make it asynchronous? Should we make the "host" do it following a frame "tick"?
