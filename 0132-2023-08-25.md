## Accomplishments

*   To do bulk runs of tests described in [0131](./0131-2023-08-24.md) I created the script [`harden_test.sh`](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt04-raybox-zero/blob/main/harden_test.sh).

*   I ran it and it tries to do the 8 different OpenLane hardening runs (currently the last 4 fail due to the yosys-abc bug). On my laptop it completes within about 46 minutes, writing `stats.md` which can be rendered as Markdown. Here are the stats from the design as it currently stands:

## Next steps

*   Do the [proposed changes from yesterday](./0131-2023-08-24.md#next-steps) and measure them.
*   Report issues to Matt and Uri -- target clock 25MHz instead of 50MHz; and SYNTH_STRATEGY=4 -- and propose a way to override these via `info.yaml` in future.


# Setting Gnome Terminal tab titles

Add this to `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
# Function to set Gnome terminal title. For more info, see:
# https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/186167
function set-title() {
  if [[ -z "$ORIG" ]]; then
    ORIG=$PS1
  fi
  TITLE="\[\e]2;$*\a\]"
  PS1=${ORIG}${TITLE}
}
```

Use it like this:
```bash
set-title This is my tab title
```

Note that the `$*` part automatically merges all args into 1 string.

**NEXT:** Figure out how to make a new-pwd handler or prompt (PS1) extension that does this automatically, optionally using one of: (a) relative path; (b) path suffix; (c) repo name/branch; (d) a mapping file of some kind; (e) a per-project/dir file e.g. first heading yanked from README.

Use this example as a guide:
```bash
parse_git_branch() {
     git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/(\1)/'
}
export PS1="[\t] \u@\h \[\e[32m\]\w \[\e[91m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\e[00m\]$ "
```
