## Installing Arduino Libraries

This _might_ be an old method, but it seems to work, from [Adafruit-Trinket-USB repo's README](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Trinket-USB/blob/master/README.md):

> Arduino libraries allowing Trinket to act as USB devices
> 
> NOTE: This folder contains multiple libraries. Each library must be installed individually. Simply installing the master folder won't work. Move each library folder out of the master after you unzip into your libraries folder.

To this end, I did the following:

1.  [Downloaded a ZIP](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Trinket-USB/archive/master.zip) of the repo.
2.  Extracted it.
3.  Recompressed the `TrinketHidCombo` folder into its own ZIP.
4.  Went into Arduino IDE's menu: `Sketch` => `Include Library` => `Add .ZIP Library...`
5.  Chose the `TrinketHidCombo.zip` file.
6.  The middle status line of the Arduino IDE reported: `Library added to your libraries. Check "Include library" menu`.
7.  I was then able to open [this example](https://www.instructables.com/id/DIGIKEYPAD-DigiSpark/#step9) (specifically [`code.ino`](https://cdn.instructables.com/ORIG/F5T/UU69/JD4UZP0V/F5TUU69JD4UZP0V.ino)) and "`Verify`" it. It gave this warning, but still seemed to compile:
    ```
    In file included from /Users/anton/Documents/Arduino/libraries/TrinketHidCombo/usbdrvasm_includer.S:24:0:
    /Users/anton/Documents/Arduino/libraries/TrinketHidCombo/usbdrv/usbdrvasm.S:17:0: warning: "__SFR_OFFSET" redefined
    #define __SFR_OFFSET 0      /* used by avr-libc's register definitions */
    
    In file included from /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware/tools/avr/avr/include/avr/io.h:99:0,
                    from /Users/anton/Documents/Arduino/libraries/TrinketHidCombo/cmdline_defs.h:26,
                    from /Users/anton/Documents/Arduino/libraries/TrinketHidCombo/usbdrvasm_includer.S:22:
    /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware/tools/avr/avr/include/avr/sfr_defs.h:141:0: note: this is the location of the previous definition
    #    define __SFR_OFFSET 0x20
    
    Sketch uses 5448 bytes (90%) of program storage space. Maximum is 6012 bytes.
    Global variables use 123 bytes of dynamic memory.
    ```
    Note that the "library" has been placed in `~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/TrinketHidCombo`, and note also that most of the available program space has been used.
8.  I don't know if it matters, but I _didn't_ then do `Sketch` => `Include Library` => `TrinketHidCombo` -- it seemed to work without doing so. When I actually tried selecting that option, it just added all the `.h` files (I think) to my Sketch's code, that it could find in the library:
    ```cpp
    #include <TrinketHidComboC.h>
    #include <cmdline_defs.h>
    #include <TrinketHidCombo.h>
    #include <usbconfig.h>
    ```
    This made no difference to the output of the compilation.
9.  I'm not sure if the warning shown above matters. Discussion about it [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Trinket-USB/issues/22) and [here](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=77557) -- evidently it doesn't matter. "SFR" stands for "[Special Function Register](https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__sfr__notes.html)". Lots more discussion [here](https://community.platformio.org/t/trinketkeybaord-library-atiny85-compiles-in-arduino-ide-but-not-in-pio/5882) but probably not overly relevant. Also [this](https://www.avrfreaks.net/forum/io-port-address-decoding).

## More USB/HID stuff

*   `TrinketHidCombo` is like `TrinketKeyboard`, but can do both keyboard and mouse HID commands in the same library?

## Other notes

*   Is it worth learning more about PlatformIO? Is it an Arduino-compatible dev environment that works inside VSCode?

## Next goals

1.  Try `TrinketKeyboard`.
2.  Compare (inc. size and capabilities) with `TrinketHidCombo`.
3.  Try getting/setting keyboard status LEDs.
4.  Try various USB HID commands/modes.
