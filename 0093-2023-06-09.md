## Following the Pi Pico C/C++ SDK guide

Ref: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/c_sdk.html

I'll do this under my Linux VM first.

1.  `sudo adduser zerotoasic dialout`
2.  Log out desktop completely and log back in.
3.  Plug in Pi Pico and pass thru to Linux VM. Optionally make it permanent.
    Can check if it engaged properly by looking at tail of `dmesg -T`;
    expect it mounted as `/dev/ttyACM0`.
