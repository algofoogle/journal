# Current steering DAC experiments

I spent some time recently in the [`maybe` branch](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/tree/maybe) trying to figure out a better current-steering DAC that actually uses differential (I think?) steering, i.e. pairs of FETs per bit, to 'steer' equal current in opposing directions.

[I did 15 commits](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/compare/5585b7b...5e626a2b74ba02a781096ecff4136280b4635ad8) before pausing again prior to today.

## Notable experiments include...

### [03-nfet-sweep3.sch](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/maybe/xschem/03-nfet-sweep3.sch)

3rd of 3 tests of DC sweep of gate voltage, plus comparing different transistor sizing/ratios:

### [04-csdac1.sch](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/maybe/xschem/04-csdac1.sch)

Kind of a recreation of [bdac.sch as described in 0209](./0209-2024-07-23.md#bdacsch) (binary-weighted switched current DAC), except: (a) each bit is tested in turn via SPICE instead of testing the full 0..255 range; and (b) focus on measuring/balancing actual path current without conversion to voltage:

### [05-csdac2.sch](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/maybe/xschem/05-csdac2.sch)

Extending 04 (above) to test out full range. NOTE: Extra smoothing cap (hanging off `dacout`; not in repo) added in this screenshot, to make the lumpy ramp clearer:

* Green: Mprog width is 1.0um.
* Red: Mprog width is 0.9um.


### [05a-adjusted.sch](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/maybe/xschem/05a-adjusted.sch)

Adjusting 05 (above) to try and get a better curve (tested with more sweeps):

### [05b-moresweep.sch](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/maybe/xschem/05b-moresweep.sch)

Trying some more variations in sweeps. Looking pretty chunky:

### [06a-sorta.sch](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/maybe/xschem/06a-sorta.sch)

Screenshot below is altered from actual repo, but shows a sort of workable curve. Big pull-down transistors though:

### [09-w2w.sch](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/maybe/xschem/09-w2w.sch)

Trying a W2W CDAC. Sort of works, but pretty ugly:

![09-w2w](i/0210-09-w2w.png)

Not much better when using a pull-down resistor instead of FET; slightly more linear but terribly lumpy.

### [10-steer.sch](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/maybe/xschem/10-steer.sch)

First true (?) current-steering DAC, i.e. differential. Great linearity, but only because of binary clusters of equally-sized transistors. NOTE: Image below is smoothed with caps (not present in repo):

### [11-ratioed.sch](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/maybe/xschem/11-ratioed.sch)

Evolution of 10 (above): Attempt to use sensibly-sized transistors. Not too bad. Some bumps still, but pretty good. Current consumption is ~500uA. NOTE: I separately measured the pull-up resistor loads later; max. was about 435uA on either (needing 4.35um width?), meaning Vbias transistor pair must be drawing ~65uA. Could work with 1k resistors too, but this reduces the voltage swing from ~1.1Vpp to ~0.45Vpp.

![11-ratioed](i/0210-11-ratioed.png)

NOTE: Resistors could also be replaced with NFETs:

![11-ratioed with NFETs](i/0210-11-nfets.png)

...or PFETs:

![11-ratioed with PFETs](i/0210-11-pfets.png)

What about this (gamma correction maybe?):

# Next steps

*   Rote exercise: Reassemble `tt-vga-fun` using simple RDACs but new digital control block (approx. at commit [`12bbe7f`](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/commit/12bbe7fc066ac0bb418f734f622e503c4a6524d3)).
*   Use TT08 3v3 template for future experiments: In case we decide to try 3.3V at some point, we're already in it.
*   Try unary ('thermometer') coding for 3 MSBs. These COULD be driven just from the digital block, rather than having to implement the decoder in the DAC.
*   Would it work to do 3 levels of unary coding? i.e. 2 MSBs for 0-3 big transistors, middle 3 bits for 0-7 medium transistors, bottom 3 bits for 0-7 tiny transistors?
