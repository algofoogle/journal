# GFMPW-1: Trying to fix UPW harden for gf180-rbz-fsm

*   Looked at Tholin's and ReJ's projects and they just use the generic SDC file; no changes at all.
*   Some of their designs have clock periods on the order of 6ns! Tholin's SID is 166.6ns (6MHz), tho.
*   `make user_project_wrapper` on this repo yields only fanout errors.
*   Added shortcut:
    ```bash
    # Shortcut for summary.py.
    # Usage: olsum SUMMARY_TYPE [DESIGN [EXTRA_ARGS]]
    # SUMMARY_TYPE is e.g. full-summary.
    # DESIGN defaults to user_project_wrapper.
    # EXTRA_ARGS is appended if supplied after DESIGN.
    function olsum() {
        stype=$1; shift
        design=${1:-user_project_wrapper}; shift
        echo summary.py --caravel --design "$design" --$stype $@
        summary.py --caravel --design "$design" --$stype $@
    }
    ```

# Test 1

*   I'm doing a test without and with the generic SDC file. This is what I did:
    *   Used 25ns CLOCK_PERIOD in UPW.
    *   Kept 
    *   Moved all old run data (Legion 5 laptop) to openlane/ARCHIVED
    *   Made top_ew_algofoogle (TEA) use wb_clk_i instead of `io_in[11]`.
    *   Loaded env: `env-gf180`
    *   Started `time make top_ew_algofoogle` using 3 configured cores.
*   Next I did this:
    *   Modify UPW config.json to use correct CLOCK_PORT for `wb_clk_i`.
    *   `make user_project_wrapper`
    *   Copy the symlinks of these runs and name them `test-1`, to refer back to this section.

NOTE: I think we can ignore fanout in UPW because it is incorrectly using a fanout of 10 (instead of 4) and all fanouts should be from within the design macros anyway...?


# Test 2

*   Change number of cores on the VM to 8, and maybe 6 or 7 for routing.
*   Do exactly the same runs, but with generic SDC file now added in.
*   Compare results, esp:
    *   Does it change the GDS at all? Hopefully not. If it does, add 'antennas' to the checklists below.

Results for TEA:

*   NOTE: I've noticed there is a subtle difference between TEA test-1 and test-2. Same area and pin placement, and what LOOKS like basically the same cell placement, but slightly different routing.

# Test 3

*   Change UPW CLOCK_PERIOD to 35 instead of 25. Does it make a difference? Only need to run it for UPW.

Results for UPW:

*   Time: 3:39
*   GDS size: 
*   Details from `olsum full-summary user_project_wrapper --run`:
    *   WNS: 0??

    *   **Typical min: -1.69 -- HOLD VIO**

The only thing that changes is setup timing (and evidently by exactly the change in CLOCK_PERIOD).

# Test 4

*   Change TEA config.json to include:
    ```json
    "PL_RESIZER_HOLD_SLACK_MARGIN": 0.4,
    "GLB_RESIZER_HOLD_SLACK_MARGIN": 0.2,
    "PL_RESIZER_HOLD_MAX_BUFFER_PERCENT": 80,
    "GLB_RESIZER_HOLD_MAX_BUFFER_PERCENT": 80,
    ```
    ...and if necessary do something similar for `_SETUP_` equivalents. Note that the figures above represent &times;4 for Holds, and would be &times;8 for Setups.
*   Run on Legion 7 laptop.

Results for TEA:

NOTE: This [failed](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane/issues/2061) with a crash as it has done a few times at step 20, so I changed `FP_CORE_UTIL` from 35 to 34.

# Test 5

*   Ease off hold slack margins (&times;2 instead of &times;4).

# Test 6

*   Better assignment of IOs and LAs
*   Reduce or remove gpout muxes
*   Rename `top_ew_algofoogle` to `top_raybox_zero_fsm`
*   Remember:
    *   Create `top_raybox_zero_fsm.v` in raybox-zero repo.
    *   Create a snippet for it, to add to UPW.
    *   Make registered outputs cover the new direct RGB outputs.
    *   Change gf180-base README example to use new name.

Results: TBC

# Test 7

*   Fix (or at least decide on) user_defines
*   FSM wrapper for SHMUL
*   Try 40ns CLOCK_PERIOD for TEA
*   Test on FPGA too

# Test 8

*   Try reducing density
*   Are there any SDC constraints we can put in to help things?
*   Move macro placement


# Next steps

*   Update README to include instructions for hardening, inc. env vars.
*   Extra raybox-zero improvements: Store extra 2 bits from texture memory, and make it selectable via gpouts.
*   Change `GFMPW1_SNIPPET_top_raybox_zero_fsm.v` to use local names ('rbz_fsm_io...' instead of direct 'io...') so it can be easily wired up with a mux.
*   Do we need more `a0s` and `a1s`? Do we need to do `io_out[]` assignments for pins that are never outputs?
