Can we optimise [yesterday's](0034-2020-06-22.md) work on [`test07b`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/tree/master/fpga/XC9572XL/test07/t07b), or does Xilinx ISE already do a great job of optimising for us?

Fitter tells us:

Since the HSYNC timing is based on multiples of 16, let's see if that will help...

I tried a bunch of different ways to write "divide-by-N" DFF-style logic instead of the na√Øve comparisons with fixed numbers, and they all made things seemingly use more resources.

I ended up doing the main pixel (per line) counter like this:

```verilog
// Count "half-pixels" (because of 50MHz clock instead of 25MHz) per line:
reg [10:0] hcount; // 0..1599
always @(posedge CLK50) hcount <= hcount==1599 ? 0 : hcount+1;
```

I then can divide `hcount` by 32 to get an index to a 16-pixel `chunk` of the line:

```verilog
// Get 16-pixel "chunk" index from hcount:
wire [5:0] chunk;
assign chunk = hcount[10:5];
```

Note that the whole line is 800 "pixels" and hence 50 "chunks".

Then I tried a few different ways to generate HSYNC:
1.  This method is relatively efficient on resources, but is not clocking HSYNC as a register, so it might be unstable:
    ```verilog
    // Generate HSYNC from chunk:
    assign hsync = ~(chunk>=41 && chunk<=46);
    ```
2.  This uses a register to help make it more stable:
    ```verilog
    reg hsync_latch;
    always @(posedge CLK50) hsync_latch <= ~(chunk>=41 && chunk<=46);
    assign hsync = hsync_latch;
    ```
    ...the whole design uses 12 MC, 12 Reg, 11 FBI, and 19 PT.
3.  This slightly different approach only changes the `hsync_latch` register as the system enters chunk 41 (where it asserts HSYNC by pulling it low), or as it enters chunk 47 (where it releases HSYNC by pulling it high):
    ```verilog
    reg hsync_latch;
    always @(posedge CLK50)
    begin
      if (chunk==41) hsync_latch <= 0; // Assert HSYNC.
      if (chunk==47) hsync_latch <= 1; // Release HSYNC.
    end
    assign hsync = hsync_latch;
    ```
    ...and the whole design uses 12 MC, 12 Reg, **22 FBI, and 18 PT**.
4.  Interestingly, this variation on no. 3 above seems to be the best:
    ```verilog
    reg hsync_latch;
    always @(posedge CLK50)
    begin
    if (chunk[5] & (&chunk[3:0]))             hsync_latch <= 1; // Release HSYNC.
    else if (chunk[5] & chunk[3] & chunk[0])  hsync_latch <= 0; // Assert HSYNC.
    end
    assign hsync = hsync_latch;
    ```
    ...with the whole design using 12 MC, 12 Reg, **11 FBI, and 18 PT**.

I tried using a similar approach for VSYNC:

```verilog
reg vsync_latch;
always @(posedge CLK50)
begin
       if ((&vcount[8:5]) & vcount[3] & vcount[2]) vsync_latch <= 1; // Release VSYNC if we hit line 492.
  else if ((&vcount[8:5]) & vcount[3] & vcount[1]) vsync_latch <= 0; // Assert VSYNC if we hit line 490.
end
assign vsync = vsync_latch;
```

...but it used an extra Product Term and a lot more Function Block Inputs than just doing it like this:

```verilog
// Drive VSYNC based on line counter:
reg vsync_latch;
always @(posedge CLK50) vsync_latch <= ~(vcount>=480+10 && vcount<480+10+2);
assign vsync = vsync_latch;
```

Note, re `chunk` numbers;
*   Chunk 41: 41&times;16 = 640+16, which is the combined active video area and front porch.
*   Chunk 47: 47&times;16 = 640+16+96, which runs us up to the start of the back porch.

I'm putting `test07c` on ice for now.
