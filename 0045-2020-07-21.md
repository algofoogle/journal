Looking into stuff on video generation for PAL or NTSC. Composite colour, basically:
*   [This](http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=173791#p173791) is part of a discussion where someone captured a PAL NES (actually famiclone) raw video signal output signal and saved it as a PNG:
    *   Captures are referenced [here](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PAL_video) with discussion about how the "phase alternating" part works.
    *   [250MHz capture](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/File:PAL_signal_6538_250MHz.png)
    *   [53.2MHz downsampling](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/File:PAL_signal_6538_53.2MHz.png) i.e. (12&times; subcarrier frequency).
    *   Note that both of these capture just one "field" of 312 lines. I found I could get the right aspect ratio by scaling up on the Y axis by 32&times; (using "Nearest Neighbor" scaling in Photoshop, for example, i.e. just repeating pixels rather than filtering).
    *   There's also a [500MHz capture referenced here](http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=173804#p173804).
    *   NOTE: I'm not sure what this is actually meant to look like. Obviously lots of colour cells. Probably comes from [this](http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=172445#p172445). Interesting what the patterning looks like. I can see how the phase "shifts" a little on every other line, but then what's the purpose of the full inversion on the next 2 lines?
    *   Actually [this](http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=172445#p172445) (from above) might be a great place to learn more, including through the rest of the discussion.
*   Info on [Composite artifact colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_artifact_colors).
*   Lots of detail on [composite CGA 1024-colour](https://int10h.org/blog/2015/04/cga-in-1024-colors-new-mode-illustrated/) (including some details about NTSC and quadrature colour).
*   A lot of NES NTSC detail [here](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NTSC_video) including colour phase stuff, and example C code for generating the signals.
*   [Video Signal Fundamentals](http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/370524V-01/TOC15.htm)
*   Consider searching for "CVBS" to refer to "Color Video, Blanking and Sync" (aka Composite Video).
*   Also search for QAM ("[Quadrature amplitude modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation)"). Re PAL, see: [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL#Colour_encoding).

*   Here's some info on decoding PAL colour: http://www.techmind.org/vd/paldec.html (see program link at the bottom). More info from that author [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20180103003544/http://colour-recovery.wikispaces.com/).
