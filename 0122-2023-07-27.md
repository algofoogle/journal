# tt04-solo-squash stuff

## Chores

*   After implementing SPI and other improvements, make sure it's possible to test them
    with the Verilator sim.
*   Write better cocotb and/or Verilog tests.
*   Come up with a way to read and render VGA frame from VCD data.
*   Try GL sim with cocotb-to-VCD (inc. gate-level 1ns+ delay test) to make sure:
    (a) tests still pass; and (b) VCD still renders VGA frame as expected.
*   Make VCD-to-VGA-frame rendering support greater than pixel-clock resolution,
    i.e. if a 640x480 VGA frame is actually 800x525 pixels, then 3x this is
    2400x1575 (sort of fits the key stuff in 2560x1440), and 4x is 3200x2100 (fits
    in 3840x2160). In fact, why not just render at 10x direct to PNG, then we can inspect
    in Photoshop and get 4ns horizontal resolution.
*   Update READMEs.
