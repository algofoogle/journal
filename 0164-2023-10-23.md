# Implementing QSPI in tt05vsr and raybox-zero

# Accomplishments

*   tt05vsr can do QSPI. Not buffered yet, but generally works.
*   raybox-zero can do QSPI textures now, rendering in full RGB222.
*   texy.py updated to support raybox-zero's texture format.

# ISSUES

*   I was getting lots of noise problems when doing QSPI. I made a protoboard for the memory chip. This seemed to fix it for the AT25SF081B, but not *completely* for the BG25Q80. The problem sort of seems to be something to do with glitching (maybe ringing?) on SCLK.


# Plan of attach

*   Add a logic switch to run different tests (quad mode) in the 2nd half of the screen.
*   Don't worry about buffering for now. Just do direct quad IO output to screen.
*   Map `in[2:0]` to B, G, and R middle bits.
*   Map `in[3]` to a left shift (brighten) for overall BGR111 value.

# Sequence for: Quad Output Fast Read Array (6Bh)

Per [command 6Bh in datasheet](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/document/dst/at25sf081b-datasheet#page=18&zoom=100,62,550),
below is the sequence for AT25SF081B, and I think also Winbond W25Q parts, and probably most QSPI devices:
0.  QE bit must be set. This can be *programmed into* the chip in advance.
    Other options exist, but out of scope. Hence this design assumes your
    SPI chip already has QE bit set automatically at power-on.
1.  Assert /CS, make sure io0 is set to OUTPUT.
2.  Clock in CMD[7:0] = 6Bh
3.  Clock in ADDR[23:0]
4.  (On falling SCLK edge of cycle 31 (CLK rising edge beginning cycle 32) switch io0 to INPUT.)
5.  Do 8 more dummy clocks
6.  Read then starts:
    *   For each even clock after that, chip should give us D[7:4] on io[3:0].
    *   For each odd clock after that, chip should give us D[3:0] on io[3:0].
7.  When we want to stop reading, release /CS, and io0 could *probably* just stay in INPUT mode since the next round will start with step 1 above again, when includes setting io0 back to OUTPUT.

# Next steps

*   tt05vsr:
    *   CANCELLED: Change spi_out0 state checker to wrap line counter at 256 (so quad mode reads from address 0 instead of 256<<4).
    *   Recommend 1k&ohm; resistor in series with io[0] when initially testing on TT05 chip. This is because I don't have a proper reset, etc.
    *   Instructions should include mention of pre-setting QE bit, plus things to be wary of.
    *   Check io[3:0] VCD from cocotb simulation/tests, with `spiflash` **disabled** (allowing HiZ).
    *   Replace `spiflash` with Winbond Verilog model, for cocotb purposes.
*   raybox-zero:
    *   Option to use bitwise textures vs. texture SPI chip.
    *   Map memory (i.e. simple local map memory we can edit via SPI).
    *   SPI reg editing of higher texture addresses, and possible mapping of texture addresses?
    *   Implement SPI reg access via PicoDeo (needs de0nano TOP updated to wire up SPI reg signals)

# Notes

*   Colour format used by raybox-zero is currently bgrxBGRx where 'x' is unused, lowercase is LSB of each colour channel, and uppercase is MSB. I call this '2bgrx' in texy.py.
*   What happens if you try to do QSPI Quad Fast Read command 6Bh without QE bit enabled? Does it still output data with 4-bit alignments, but only MISO is valid? Or does it output nothing? Something we can test...
*   How realistic is it to do DisplayPort with only 50MHz bandwidth?
*   Can we do [1920x1200](http://tinyvga.com/vga-timing/1920x1200@60Hz) resolution or [1920x1440](http://tinyvga.com/vga-timing/1920x1440@60Hz) over VGA cable?
    *   1920x1200@60Hz: All timings are evenly divisible by 8 (not 6). HSYNC is neg, VSYNC is pos. 193.16MHz div-8 is 24.145MHz.
        At div-8, on-screen pixels would be 240. If we start stored-mode at 192, we have 132 clocks (plus a little wrap-around onto the next line, if we want it, but that needs smarter state counting).
    *   1920x1440@60Hz: All timings are evenly divisible by 8 (not 6). HSYNC is neg, VSYNC is pos. 234.0MHz clock div-8 is 29.25MHz.
        At div-8, on-screen pixels would be 240. If we start stored-mode at 192, we have 133 clocks (plus a little wrap-around onto the next line, if we want it, but that needs smarter state counting).
