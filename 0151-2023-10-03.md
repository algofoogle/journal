# More SPI flash ROM stuff

*   Fast I/O modes are interesting: Allows for skipping the 8-clock command shift between asserting /CS, and *when* reasserting /CS allows for fast address load.
*   I installed minicom, screen, and picocom on Linux: `sudo apt install minicom screen picocom`
*   Add my user to `dialout` group for permission to use TTY devices/modems: `sudo adduser user dialout`
*   Reload groups: `newgrp dialout` -- BEWARE: This seems to reset recent bash command history.
*   Need to build flashrom from source to get newer version inc. `--progress` and optionally to try adding other modes and chip IDs.
*   Aborting a flashrom run on the BP will not reset the BP. Need to replug it.
*   With baud rate of 250,000 there is a difference between 250k SPI and 2M SPI: It goes from 1:37 to 1:04
*   Baud rates supported between Linux and Bus Pirate:

    | minicom speed | Bus Pirate BRG raw value | Actual baud | Error % |
    |-:|-:|-:|
    |  250000 | 15 |   250,000 | 0.00 |
    |  460800 |  8 |   444,444 | 3.55 |
    |  500000 |  7 |   500,000 | 0.00 |
    |  576000 |  6 |   571,429 | 0.79 |
    |  921000 |  3 | 1,000,000 | 7.90 |
    | 1000000 |  3 | 1,000,000 | 0.00 |
    | 2000000 |  1 | 2,000,000 | 0.00 |

    BRG calculation: <code>(4,000,000 &div; baud) - 1</code> rounded to nearest integer

    Actually others are supported, but have to be compatible with BRG.
*   Try connecting per [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bus_Pirate#Communication):
    *   minicom seems to want to use hardware flow control, which is not compatible...? Can fix it with CTRL+A then O, then F.
    *   `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 8N1` works OK. Use CTRL+A then `\` to terminate.
    *   `picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0` seems fine. Use CTRL+A then CTRL+X to terminate.

# Building flashrom from source

1.  ```bash
    cd ~/anton
    mkdir 3p
    cd 3p
    git clone git@github.com:flashrom/flashrom
    cd flashrom
    ```
2.  Build with `make`:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    Well that was easy! Produces `flashrom` binary.
3.  `./flashrom --version`:
    ```
    flashrom 1.4.0-devel (git:v1.2-1359-g230a1d56) on Linux 6.2.0-33-generic (x86_64)
    flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org

    Using clock_gettime for delay loops (clk_id: 1, resolution: 1ns).
    ```
4.  Let's stry a known-good test using this new version:
    ```bash
    time ./flashrom -c 'EN25Q80(A)' --force -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,spispeed=1M,serialspeed=250000 -r BG25Q80-ESP01-J.bin -VVV
    ```
    Completes successfully in 1:09
5.  I then tried:
    ```bash
    time ./flashrom -c 'EN25Q80(A)' --force -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,spispeed=1M,serialspeed=500k -r BG25Q80-ESP01-K.bin -VVV
    ```
    ...but it failed at around 0x19800 (~104kB).
6.  I tried a bunch of other hacks including providing a way to explicitly set Linux baud rate and BRG value, but I couldn't get it much faster than 400,000 and that was unstable. It seems 250,000 is safest.


# Next steps

*   Simple DE0-Nano design to read data from SPI flash ROM and display it on screen:
    *   Start with single-bit SPI stream reads out via 1 RGB channel bit.
    *   Work up to QSPI.
    *   Can SPI SCLK be linked directly to our main clock for maximum through-put?
*   DE0-Nano custom clock speed using PLL.
*   [Different VGA speeds](http://tinyvga.com/vga-timing) (even if lower resolution), e.g. give SPI a workout at:
    *   [640x480@75Hz](http://tinyvga.com/vga-timing/640x480@75Hz) (31.5MHz)
    *   [640x480@85Hz](http://tinyvga.com/vga-timing/640x480@85Hz) (36.0MHz; 832w)
    *   [720x400@85Hz](http://tinyvga.com/vga-timing/720x400@85Hz) (35.5MHz; 936w, 216 clocks in HBLANK)
    *   [800x600@56Hz](http://tinyvga.com/vga-timing/800x600@56Hz) (36.0MHz, 1024w, 224 clocks in HBLANK) -- Could be 400x300
    *   [800x600@60Hz](http://tinyvga.com/vga-timing/800x600@60Hz) (40.0MHz, 1056w, 256 clocks in HBLANK)
    *   [1024x768@60Hz](http://tinyvga.com/vga-timing/1024x768@60Hz) (65.0MHz) -- But would be 512x768 or 512x384 with 160w clocks in HBLANK
    *   [1440x900@60Hz](http://tinyvga.com/vga-timing/1440x900@60Hz) (106.47MHz) -- Instead do &div;3 (~35.5MHz) for 480x900 with 154w clocks in HBLANK
*   Upgrade BP to community firmware 7.x

# Notes

*   Should upgrade BP firmware: https://github.com/flashrom/flashrom/blob/230a1d56f1100e74c407f6db4443f4e3df068b4a/buspirate_spi.c#L552-L559
*   An issue that might be contributing to poor Ubuntu VM performance, noticed in `journalctl -k` (same as `dmesg`?):
    ```
    Oct 03 11:15:28 asic-ubuntu-2204 kernel: [drm] vmwgfx: mob memory overflow. Consider increasing guest RAM and graphicsMemory.
    Oct 03 11:15:28 asic-ubuntu-2204 kernel: [drm:vmw_host_printf [vmwgfx]] *ERROR* Failed to send host log message.
    Oct 03 11:15:28 asic-ubuntu-2204 kernel: [drm] vmwgfx: increasing guest mob limits to 2097152 kB.
    ```
    This is while the graphics memory is already set to 256MB.
    NOTE: VMSVGA (needed for 3D acceleration) is apparently a VMware-based one which Linux can use via the vmwgfx kernel driver.
*   What is the [Binary Ninja] reverse engineering tool and how does it compare to Ghidra? Hmm, it appears to be commercial.

> Oracle VM VirtualBox supports memory ballooning only on 64-bit hosts. It is not supported on macOS hosts.
> Memory ballooning does not work well with large pages enabled. To turn off large pages support for a VM, run `VBoxManage modifyvm vmname --large-pages off`
