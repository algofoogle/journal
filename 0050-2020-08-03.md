## Verilator

Let's built event-driven simulation models, in C++, from Verilog, using Verilator!

The goal: Use [vgasim](https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim) to display a simulation of my VGA controller. Optionally see if we can sneak in actual user interaction that generates signals ad-hoc.

This might depend on Linux?
*   vgasim is designed for GTK+.
*   Other screen-based rendering is designed for SDL2.

[nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) might also be worth another look.

There is actually *another* project called "[VgaSim](https://sourceforge.net/p/vgasim/wiki/Home/)" which apparently is an alpha that displays a screen based on a raw text file of signal inputs. Might be good enough for me, for now. Looks like it's available for Windows and maybe Linux? https://sourceforge.net/projects/vgasim/files/1.0.0%20alpha/ - I had a look at the source, and it's pretty primitive, but easy to understand.

I will try installing Verilator for macOS first. There is a Homebrew package for it, apparently:

```
 brew info verilator
verilator: stable 4.038 (bottled), HEAD
Verilog simulator
https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator
Not installed
From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/verilator.rb
License: LGPL-3.0
==> Options
--HEAD
    Install HEAD version
```

[4.038](https://github.com/verilator/verilator-announce/issues/35) seems to be the [latest version](https://github.com/verilator/verilator-announce/issues) at the time of writing, released 2020-07-11.

Doing `brew install verilator` seemed to work fine and now I have:

```
$ verilator --version
Verilator 4.038 2020-07-11 rev v4.036-114-g0cd4a57ad
```

Tutorial time: See [Gisselquist Technology's "Taking a New Look at Verilator" article](http://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html).

There is a very clear example of how to get started – [Example C++ Execution](https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/wiki/Manual-verilator#EXAMPLE-C-EXECUTION) – and I followed it:
1.  Create [`our.v`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/master/fpga/verilator/test01/t01a/our.v) -- the module under test.
2.  Create [`sim_main.cpp`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/master/fpga/verilator/test01/t01a/sim_main.cpp) -- test bench, utilising Verilator to drive the simulation.
3.  Run: `verilator -Wall --cc our.v --exe --build sim_main.cpp`
4.  This seems to have run Clang to produce a bunch of output files in [`obj_dir`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/tree/master/fpga/verilator/test01/t01a/obj_dir). The nature of these files is described [here](https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/wiki/Manual-verilator#FILES). Main thing is that it creates our executable: `obj_dir/Vour`
5.  Run `obj_dir/Vour`:
    ```
    $ obj_dir/Vour 
    Hello World
    - our.v:2: Verilog $finish
    ```
6.  Can build again at any time by doing:
    ```bash
    cd obj_dir; make -f Vour.mk ; cd ..
    ```

### Things learned

*   Test bench can manipulate/use signals exposed by the module under test. For example, this test bench (testing a module called `module`, hence `Vmodule`) toggles the `i_clk` input signal:
    ```c++
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include "Vmodule.h"
    #include "verilated.h"

    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        // Initialize Verilators variables
        Verilated::commandArgs(argc, argv);

        // Create an instance of our module under test
        Vmodule *tb = new Vmodule;

        // Tick the clock until we are done
        while(!Verilated::gotFinish()) {
            tb->i_clk = 1;
            tb->eval();
            tb->i_clk = 0;
            tb->eval();
        } exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
    }
    ```
*   Verilator will stop simulation when it encounters `$finish` or when you hit <kbd>CTRL+C</kbd>.
