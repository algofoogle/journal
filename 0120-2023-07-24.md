# tt04-solo-squash next steps

*   Clean up solo_squash a bit, e.g. remove `CARAVEL_IO_OEB` and make debug stuff controllable by `` `define ``s.
*   Make sure solo_squash is still runnable via Verilator -- try to get it to work in Linux and Windows.
*   Make solo_squash a git submodule of tt04-solo-squash. Test that it works via Verilator and GDS GHAs.
*   Update READMEs
*   Remove LZC.
*   Tidy up TT-level debug stuff.
*   Implement SPI control stuff. Ideas:
    *   Ball speed.
    *   "Controller" input, i.e. paddle position, pause/reset state...?
    *   Paddle size.
    *   SPI *output*, e.g. debug info and ball position?
    *   VGA parameters.
    *   Test modes.
*   Visual improvements:
    *   RGB222
    *   "Depth" e.g. shadow effect
    *   Staggered bricks in wall
    *   Visual reactions to hits
*   Other improvements:
    *   Paddle top/bottom collisions only invert 1 ball direction.
    *   Different ball direction speeds (i.e. vectors).
    *   LFSR generates "obstacles" for the ball.

# Changes to make it build in Windows

*   NOTE: I already had my build env working in Windows using wingw-w64.
*   In solo_squash I ran `make clean sim` and found I had to fix it:
    1.  Had to comment out `#include <err.h>` which doesn't seem to be used anyway.
    2.  Linking failed due to missing `WinMain`. I think I had to put a wrapper
        in for this in Raybox, so I'll do that here too.
*   I borrowed a bunch of stuff from Raybox's Makefile, including:
    *   `winrand.bat`
    *   Defining `WINDOWS` and fixes for various `CFLAG`s.
    *   Including `.exe` suffix on sim exe when needed.

# Notes

*   `make test` not yet tested on Windows. Need to install iverilog first.
*   Can Verilog variables be defined via OpenLane config with TT?
*   Need to decide whether we still want `DEBUG_OUTPUT` signals for TT purposes.
*   Should SPI commands be handled by a wrapper, and feed signals directly into solo_squash,
    or should solo_squash internally implement SPI?
*   Method to add solo_squash as submodule of tt04-solo-squash:
    ```bash
    cd tt04-solo-squash
    git submodule add git@github.com:algofoogle/solo_squash src/solo_squash
    # ...if necessary, go into src/solo_squash and use git to select a different branch/commit?...
    git commit -am "Added src/solo_squash submodule"
    ```
*   To later update git submodules:
    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```
