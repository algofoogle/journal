## Pico-DE0 notes

*   I implemented basic command argument support (`getarg_str` and `getarg_u32`).
*   New commands:
    *   `o` _{outmask}_ - Configure outputs: Each high bit in _outmask_ will configure its corresponding GPIO to be an output.
    *   `i` _{inmask}_ - Configure inputs: As above, but to configure GPIOs as inputs.
    *   `=` _{set_mask}_ _{set_vals}_ - Set GPIOs identified in _set_mask_ to corresponding values in _set_vals_.
    *   `r` - Software reset. May not allow USB-CDC to reconnect properly? Not sure yet. NOTE: Wokwi doesn't support this (watchdog-based) method.
*   It doesn't look like the pico-sdk has a high-level Hardware API call to get the "direction" of all GPIOs
    in one go, but from reading the pico-sdk source it looks like reading the [`SIO_GPIO_OE`](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/blob/6a7db34ff63345a7badec79ebea3aaef1712f374/src/rp2040/hardware_regs/include/hardware/regs/sio.h#L98-L112)
    register is the way to go, and the nice way to do this is via `sio_hw->gpio_oe`
*   NOTE: The code defines `GPIO_MASK` which is used to prevent changing the state of any GPIOs that have special Pico functions.
*   With the new commands above I've now been able to test outputs, and the DE0-Nano design appears to detect them as expected.
