# PicoDeo and raybox-bridge updates

*   `/circle` uses SPI bus mode by default, but accepts optional extra arg as `spi` or `direct`
    (but only if delay is also specified; typical is `0x4000`), e.g.:
    ```
    /circle 4000 direct
    ```
*   `/circle` accepts these keys now:
    *   `*` - Double delay
    *   `/` - Halve delay
    *   `+` - Increase delay by 1
    *   `-` - Decrease delay by 1
*   `/cursor` command now implemented to allow raybox-bridge to send cursor data to the vga_cursor
    design using SPI:
    ```
    Format:
    /cursor XHEX YHEX [COLOUR] [WIDTH] [HEIGHT]
    - XHEX and YHEX are the cursor top-left as hex values
    - COLOUR represents 3 bits: RGB (0..7)
    - WIDTH is cursor width
    - HEIGHT is cursor height
    ```
*   raybox-bridge modified to use the `/cursor` command, and it works!

# Next steps

*   Fix vga_cursor edge/overflow bug.
*   Try RP2040 SPI hardware.
*   Try faster SPI.
*   Modify raybox-bridge code to support other test modes/control of the PicoDeo firmware.
*   Implement distinct vga_cursor SPI commands that can set all data at once, or any of
    cursor_x, cursor_y, color, width, and height.
*   Make sure Raybox design still works on FPGA.
*   Try implementing SPI control on Raybox and put Raybox player control logic in raybox-bridge.
*   TT04 idea: Fake UI generator using rectangles and "bevels"?
