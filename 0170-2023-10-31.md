# top_ew_algofoogle next steps

*   Map out the days, inc. TT05
*   Get MPW9 VM running
*   Add extra features to core design (texture effects, namely)
    *   Q11.11
    *   4x texture address addends
    *   4x texture slide for U/V
    *   Map crosshair divider
    *   Switch between bitwise textures and SPI reads -- bitwise as default? Could be done with mode[2] or power-on IO pull-up sense.
    *   Map memory
*   Consider using io_in[35] as clock source instead of user_clock2 -- this would be better, if we can't turn off user_clock2
*   Update sim to use alternate clock and add on texture SPI ROM to TB
*   Change `pin_order.cfg` and reharden to assume RHS placement with user_clock2, LAs, and IO[16:8]
*   Try different hardening options with design exploration tool, e.g. reduced util (30%, 25%, 20%?)
*   Harden with updated OL1.x and CUP -- use MPW9 VM maybe?
*   Check: Does SCLK (inverted clock) get CTS?
*   Do more reading on clocks (as promised) esp. user_clock2
*   Test whether user_clock2 can be disabled or adjusted by firmware -- should be possible to sim?? Unless the DLL/PLL itself is not fully simulated.

# MPW9 VM

1.  File => Import Appliance
2.  Use Advanced/Expert mode
    1.  Increase CPUs to 8
    2.  Disable audio
3.  Other settings after import:
    1.  Disable Drag'n'Drop
    2.  3D acceleration
    3.  Shared folder: HOST_Documents
4.  Increase disk -- inc. boot and resize
    1.  File => Tools => Virtual Media Manager
    2.  Select ztoa_mpw9-disk001.vdi
    3.  Increase to 200GB
5.  First snapshot
6.  Other fixes/additions per previous VM doco (e.g. mousewheel, VSCode, GitHub ID, 256MB VRAM)
7.  Main snapshot
