# tt05-vga-spi-rom and cocotb stuff

# Goals

*   Review yesterday's ([0156](./0156-2023-10-10.md)).
*   Convert VCD to image:
    *   Via wavedrom?
    *   Directly using some other tool?
    *   Via GTKwave 'print' or screenshot?
    *   Make it happen by default in `make`, with an ENV option to disable it.
*   Find out more about RegNext and divided clock delayed reset.
*   Proving that certain signals remain known/stable during test running, e.g. `uio_oe`: cocotb coroutine to run complex test sequencing, with an `await` on any edge in the main thread?
*   VGA-DAC PCBs arrived.
