## Getting my lab set up again

*   I've got way too many electronic parts just in bags and stashed in tubs.
*   Takes too long and makes too much mess to find anything.
*   Storage drawers are pretty expensive in AU.
*   I got a 60-set of storage drawers (6&times;10 drawers), multicoloured, from Spotlight. Each drawer appears to have 1 divider. Advertised for "bead storage". AU$45 => $0.75/drawer, $0.375/cell.
*   I got a set of interlocking storage draw modules from Stratco. AU$17ea. 3 of them had 12 drawers, 1 of them had 4 large drawers: 36 small + 4 large. Heavy duty, more expensive on average. Not sure if they have dividers.
*   I got a couple of molded storage boxes from Menzel Plastics. Small compartments. Parts won't mingle, unless maybe the box is rolled around a lot.
*   I got a set of 24 screw-lid squat/flat cylindrical containers from Spotlight. Possibly good for very small loose parts, or screws. Could be stored inside other storage boxes/cases.
*   Also got a container that holds 16 flat boxes. Probably ideal for PCBs and other larger parts.
*   I wouldn't get any storage drawers from Menzel. They're too expensive. Molded storage boxes might be OK, though.
*   Stratco normally stock a 36-drawer version of the modular set, for AU$35.
*   Jaycar have a 32-drawer (plus one big drawer) version for AU$30. Might be "shaped" well. Not sure about it overall.
*   Overall, for number of compartments, Spotlight is best value, and Stratco is probably most durable.
*   Cheap as Chips often also have a $20 set with 40 compartments, but not in stock at the moment.

## Preparing for X9572XL breakout board assembly

Tools:

| Tool                  | Ready?| Notes |
|-----------------------|-------|-------|
| Flux                  | Yes   | I already had a hard flux and a flux paste tub from China. Got a flux pen and another plux paste/gel from Jaycar. Will try them all out. |
| Solder                | Yes   | Somewhere, I think I have really fine (0.3mm?) solder. For now I bought a roll of 0.71mm solder from Jaycar. |
| Soldering iron        | Yes   | My Hakko will do fine. |
| Soldering tip         | ?     | I have a few different types. Not sure they're all the ideal type I want for 0.5mm pitch QFP. |
| Solder wick/braid     | ?     | Gotta find it again. |
| Desoldering           | Yes   | Soldapault and desoldering bulb |
| Flux cleaner          | NO    | Maybe isopropanol will do? Not sure about the Orange Power I have |
| Helping hands         | Yes?  | I have some, but they're probably not very good |
| Vise                  | ?     | I have one, but not sure if it's all that good anymore |
| Cutters               | N/A?  | I have some, though side-cutters would be better
| CPLD software         | ?     | Downloaded Xilinx ISE Webpack 14.7 VM to run in VirtualBox, and it supposedly now has full Xilinx product support including XC9572XL. Need to try running it, then test out programming connection back to USB Blaster (or back to Dangerous Prototypes Bus Bluster ) |

Components:

| Component             | Ready?| Notes |
|-----------------------|-------|-------|
| PCB                   | No    | On their way from JLCPCB |
| Spacers               | ?     | I have some somewhere. Brass at least. Maybe also nylon? Need to check what kinds and what screws to use |
| XC9572XL-VQ64         | Yes   | Hopefully what I got from China actually works. If not, got some on backorder from element14 |
| 3 &times; 2k&ohm;     |       | 0805 resistors for LED current limiting |
| 2 &times; 10k&ohm;    |       | 0805 resistor for pushbutton pulldowns |
| LEDs                  | Yes?  | Variety of colours coming from element14. Some others found from GTB project |
| 2 &times; Pushbuttons | Yes   | 6mm SMD |
| Header pins           | Yes   | Heaps of SIL 0.1&Prime; |
| 5 &times; 100nF       | ?     | 0805 decoupling caps. Might have some left over from previous eBaying? |
| 2 &times; 10&micro;F  | ?     | 3528 (?) Tantalum, for power. Do I already have some, somewhere? Could I nick some from other hardware? On order from element14 otherwise |
| Power supply          |       | |
| JTAG                  |       | USB Blaster |
| AMS1117-3.3           | Yes   | SOT-223 |
| Oscillator            | No    | Not strictly needed. If used, one of the 100nF caps is used with this. A variety of 7&times;5mm SMD XOs on order from element14 |

Shopping list for future:

*   Best flux
*   Best solder
*   Soldering iron tip good for 0.5mm SMD
*   Magnification of some kind? Both for doing the work, and later for inspection (i.e. microscope)
*   Flux cleaner
*   Better holding/mounting. Can 3D printing help? Soft teflon/silicon grippers?
*   Side cutters
*   Better test clip looms
*   Proper bench-top power supply. Ideally one that can deliver 12V, 5V, 3.3V, and has current limiting (i.e. to avoid burning out a device that has a short).
