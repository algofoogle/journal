# VGA DAC

*   Doesn't have to be R2R.
*   Should we go for RGB222, or just go for RGB333?
*   Some discussion on different methods [here](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/465842/8-bit-vga-dac-design-question).
*   RGB333 could be done adequately with 4 resistors per channel,
    though 1.1k needs E24 values, or two resistors (1k + 100R).
*   RGB333 will need 12 pins (2x6): 9 for colour, 2 for sync, 1 for GND.
*   Use SMD resistors or thru-hole?

# 2D grid map collision detection and response

Tomorrow I'll have a shot at putting this into raybox-bridge (maybe copy it to a dedicated FPS-game
Python script and clean it up).

I'll need to do map-loading and probably 2D rendering to help prove that it's working as expected.

I'll then probably just convert the code from [this](https://dev.opera.com/articles/3d-games-with-canvas-and-raycasting-part-2/step-2-collision.htm) and compare it with [this](https://github.com/nicklockwood/RetroRampage/blob/master/Tutorial/Part2.md).

Note that I think the method used above is sometimes called AABB, or "axis-aligned bounding boxes".
For more info, see [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_collision_detection)
and [this](https://tutorialedge.net/gamedev/aabb-collision-detection-tutorial/).

Also [this](https://www.amanotes.com/post/using-swept-aabb-to-detect-and-process-collision)
might come in handy later for testing collisions with very thin objects and high velocities,
and [this](https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Collisions/Collision-detection) could be good
for further study.
