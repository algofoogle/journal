# wall_tracer changes

## Accomplishments

*   Using better names for FSM states.
*   Initial shared reciprocal implementation:
    *   Branch: `shared_rcp`
    *   Added lots of extra states to share a single reciprocal in wall_tracer, via a single-bit register which mux-selects the input to the register (either rayDirX or rayDirY).
    *   stepDist needs to be registered now. They are directly calculated by rcp, and rely on rayDir as inputs. rayDir is sum of facing and minified rayAddend. rayAddend is registered before PREP, then updated during DONE.
    *   WARNING: trackDist comes from trackInit, which depends on stepDist!

## Extra FSM states

These are essentially the really naive states I settled on (though I used different state names and didn't do a registered `rcp_in`):

*   SETUP_RDX_RCP: Setup rayDirX reciprocal.
    *   `rcp_in <= rayDirX`
    *   `rcp_abs <= 1`
*   WAIT_SDX: (OPTIONAL) Wait state.
    *   Do nothing
*   LOAD_SDX: Load stepDistX from rayDirX reciprocal.
    *   `stepDistX <= rcp_out` -- could be combined with next step.
*   SETUP_RDY_RCP: Setup rayDirY rcp.
    *   `rcp_in <= rayDirY`
*   WAIT_SDX: (OPTIONAL) Wait state.
    *   Do nothing
*   LOAD_SDY: Load stepDistY from rayDirY rcp.
    *   `stepDistY <= rcp_out` -- could be combined with next step.
*   TRACE_PREP:
    *   Set initial mapXY.
    *   Set trackDist, from trackInit.
*   TRACE_STEP:
    *   As-is.
*   TRACE_TEST: -- later might get complex: map setup/read states esp. for SPI flash.
    *   As-is.
*   TRACE_DONE:
    *   Modify this to use rcp to get size from vdist.
*   More states required before hitting LINE_READY (which is when we present output).

## Stats for first shared_reciprocal attempt

NOTE:
*   Still only fits 8x2 so far but looking closer to fitting 4x2.
*   ~22.2k cells reduces to ~11.3k with combo 4. A bit of an improvement over [yesterday](./0135-2023-08-28.md#fixed-pov-spi-7aae611).
*   That combo 4's clock is up to ~40MHz from ~34MHz yesterday, too.
*   There were fewer antenna violations (5, down from 7) and they're a little less severe: 575/400 was the worst.
*   Power reduced from 2.84W to 0.89W

Max. expected clocks needed for tracing:

*   Each line:
    *   Reset
    *   3 for RDX rcp
    *   3 for RDY rcp
    *   TRACE_PREP
    *   *(Corner-to-corner of 64x64 map is about 90 cells. This could mean 90 X tests, and 90 Y tests, though realistically shouldn't be more than 64 of each. Let's work with 90, though...)*
    *   180x STEP
    *   180x TEST
    *   TRACE_DONE
    *   3 for vdist rcp
    *   TOTAL: 372 max.
*   But I THINK for all reasonable cases it should be more like 12+(128*2)=268
*   This means that our 800-wide line could be made up of:
    *   270 tracing clocks.
    *   256 map overlay clocks (to avoid ROM contention).
    *   274 spare clocks -- divide by 5 means we could receive up to 54 SPI bits, but more likely 40 given MCU response time. Hence, we could load new 80-bit vectors within 2 lines (so long as they were double-buffered on input), or 144-bit vectors within 4 lines.
*   NOTE: Timing gets much worse if we need to support reading from SPI ROM. In that case, maybe it would be better to have:
    *   An initial state just for clocking out a 12-bit address (made up of half row, half column).
    *   A state to increment/decrement each independently. External logic will be needed for this.
    *   NOTE: Why just 12 bits? We could go more, and support larger and non-square maps even.

## Notes

*   To use `make clean_sim_random` on my Legion 7 Win 11 Home laptop, I had to configure the 'Windows Time' service to be auto-start (`Automatic (Delayed Start)`). This is because the script `winrand.bat` relies on it to generate a random number. A bit silly, really!
*   Combo 3 at 8x2 got stuck running way too long on detailed routing (I think over 45mins before I killed it). This was its log:

## Next steps

*   Try putting height_scaler into wall_tracer too, making it shared. Rename it: size_scaler.
*   Compare cell count when using rcp_in as a register instead of mux.
*   Try reducing size of facing/vplane vectors.
*   Try a bigger map.
*   Combine TraceStep and TraceTest if using combo map ROM. No good if using external ROM.
*   IS there a way to combine STEP and TEST? I feel like there should be:
    *   Maybe there's even a way to avoid `trackDistY-stepDistY` by holding a previous value.
*   Move the rcp OUT of wall_tracer, along with vdist-to-size?

NOTE: What we gain in sharing rcp could also be eroded by needing extra registers, mux logic, etc...
