# tt04-reciprocal

From [yesterday](./0127-2023-08-20.md#a-new-tt04-test-repo-reciprocal) I've made [tt04-reciprocal] and I'll copy in the `lzc` and `reciprocal` modules and see if we can harden them. I'll use the same paths as per [tt04-raybox-zero] in case they have anything to do with the [yosys-abc bug](./0126-2023-08-19.md#yosys-abc-core-dumped) I'm [chasing](./0127-2023-08-20.md#in-progress-trying-to-fix-gds-hardening).

I'll need a contrived wrapper because we don't have enough IOs in TT04 to fully exercise the `reciprocal` module.

Initial commit is [here](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt04-reciprocal/commit/b4b8d4012ec6972096441333c2523f16eeff342f) but I think I can do better, e.g. by loading values into registers and then streaming out. Make it SPI-based, even if bite-wide rather than bit-wide?

I then had to do a [minor fix](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt04-reciprocal/commit/50878ffcc8042d7b1b0ca5e9fdda962a6b80680b) in order for it to start building.

Let's see how this goes...
