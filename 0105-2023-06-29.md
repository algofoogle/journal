# vga_cursor initial test findings

*   I changed vga_cursor to use a 1px blue frame (to help sync), black background, and white cursor
    to help with visibility.
*   Cursor size doesn't make much *visible* difference to glitchiness. If anything, original 16x16
    seems about right.
*   Switching vga_cursor from a register method to a comparator method makes glitches impossible to
    pick up on, so I will keep the register method so it helps spot errors and debug them more easily.
*   I increased the raybox-bridge transmit rate from once every 5ms to once every 2.5ms, and it keeps
    up with 99.8% of transmits.

# Next steps

*   Try adding a PicoDeo firmware routine that runs in a loop (until interrupted) to move the cursor
    in a circle by setting GPIOs slower than a CPU could, but faster than USB commands can.
    *   This will probably be too fast to see the circle motion but should still be visible as the cursor
        occupying the locus of the circle, and should be much more likely to expose glitching.
    *   Our goals then will be to:
        1.  See what it looks like when we sample the GPIOs only during VBLANK.
        2.  See if we can trigger any uncertainty/metastability during this sampling.
        3.  Design this to work with actual externally-mastered inputs into dedicated *8-bit*
            registers, or even serially clocked in, such that it can basically never fail.
