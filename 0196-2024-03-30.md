# TT04 raybox-zero test prep

*   Still very busy as I prepare to start officially with Efabless next week.
*   TT04 chips have come back and are with [tnt](https://246tnt.com/).
*   tnt could do some basic tests even just with oscilloscope so I'll work on preparing helpful instructions for that.

## TODO

* [ ] Need to prepare proper instructions for structured testing/debugging anyway.
* [x] I've added to some of the hardware stack for my DE0-Nano FPGA devboard, so I need to document that and make sure both the `raybox-zero/de0nano` target still works correctly with it, and which GPIO signals are required for normal operation now. See [0194](./0194-2024-02-05.md) and [actual current GPIO-1 pinout](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt03p5-solo-squash/blob/409d02378738a7824ce6a5fc7910f4eaeac6434b/de0nano/tt_um_algofoogle_solo_squash_de0nano.v#L4-L67).
* [ ] Document raybox-zero versions in README, and how they relate to tt04-raybox-zero
* [ ] Work out which are the latest versions of raybox-zero (e.g. GFMPW1 version) but also find which version was submitted to EW
* [ ] Check which versions can be run in Verilator & Quartus. Fix if required.

## Anton's current DE0-Nano GPIO-1 pinout

Below are all the connections that I have on my GPIO-1 header right now, though not necessarily all of them are used for all raybox-zero versions.

NOTE: The below RGB333 DAC pinout is only used by `raybox-zero/de0nano` target if `` `define RGB3_DAC `` is used (and it typically is), in which case R0, G0, and B0 are all unused (off), and only the upper 2 bits of each colour channel are driven by the design...

                                    PIN 1 of GPIO1 header.

The K1..K4 buttons are active-high. They are pulled low by 22k resistors when open,
and pulled high by 100R when pressed.

The system clock is provided by the DE0-Nano's CLOCK_50 (50MHz) and is divided by 2 to make the typical
25MHz VGA clock.

The DE0-Nano's KEY[0] provides the reset signal.

I've [updated](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero/commit/529e1a7481f41a24bb055e51da00e36de93c15f9) the `main` branch of https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero so that the `de0nano` target now matches the above new pinout, and tested it on the hardware.

**This update is tagged `1.2`.**

## Figuring out which versions are which

*   [1.0](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero/releases/tag/1.0) (`main` branch):
    *   Actual version submitted to TT04.
    *   SPI for POV.
    *   SPI2 for 'registers', supporting: FLOOR, SKY, LEAK
    *   inc_px & inc_py inputs for demo
    *   H/VBLANK outputs
    *   **de0nano target assumes RGB111 VGA adapter**
    *   Sim `make csr` works; constantly 'animates' FLOOR/SKY/LEAK (no option to turn it off).
*   [1.1](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero/releases/tag/1.1) (`main` branch):
    *   Adds OTHER to SPI2
    *   **de0nano target updated to use RGB333 VGA DAC by default**
    *   Sim `make csr` works as per 1.0
*   [1.2](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero/releases/tag/1.2) (`main` branch):
    *   Fix for different Q values
    *   Adds VINF to SPI2
    *   Sim timing is now adaptive; adds optional MouseY=>TexV slide; `\` toggles VINF; `/` toggles SPI2 'animation'.
    *   **de0nano target updated for newer GPIO-1 pinout** (compatible with TT03p5 too).
