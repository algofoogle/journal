# Ideas for future raybox-zero versions

*   Maybe RGB333 or RGB444 output?
*   Dithered distance dimming?
*   Double-rez mode: For gen_tex only, since extra time is required for texture SPI reads otherwise, but there are probably ways around this including RGB222 6-bit packing (instead of 8-bit) and having blanking marigns during which there is extra time for SPI reads.
*   Dual LEAK (top and bottom), or high-precision LEAK/VOFFSET.
*   Byte-aligned SPI
*   Map SRAM (or regs) -- Map loading (with double-buffering or not?)
*   Registers to blank out a region, or fill a region, of the map
*   3bit map instead of 2bit?
*   Optional QSPI mode; strap extra bits high to just use "classic" mode?


# Standardizing TT/RBZ pinout and other raybox-zero pinout improvement ideas

These are some rough notes about changing the raybox-zero pinout, especially on Tiny Tapeout. It's motivated by: a change to merge the two SPI interfaces; universal support for the Digilent and Leo Moser QSPI PMODs; and trying to make room for other functions.

*   Pinout:
    *   While SPI CSb is asserted, inc_px/py (and maybe others) *could* become extra SPI in channels (since they are not sampled until new frame start otherwise).
    *   SPI slave: 3pins IN
        *   CSb
        *   SCLK
        *   MOSI (if just single channel SPI)
    *   RGB out: 8-11pins OUT
        *   HSYNC
        *   VSYNC
        *   R
        *   r
        *   G
        *   g
        *   B
        *   b
        *   Optionally 3 more RGB bits, or just a 'bright' bit (or other side: LSB?)
        *   ...need to match to what can be read in fast enough from texture ROM
    *   Texture SPI master: 5 IN pins, 1 BIDIR
        *   CSb
        *   SCLK
        *   io0 (bidir)
        *   in1
        *   in2
        *   in3
    *   Debug:
        *   Single debug pin that makes a bunch of other pins turn into debugs?
        *   GPout(s) (or equivalent; output pin overrides selectable by SPI)?
        *   reg_outs_enb
        *   gen_tex
    *   Optional demo stuff:
        *   inc_px/py
        *   and/or: inc_vp_px/py
*   Pin totals:
    *   8 IN:
        *   SPI CSb
        *   SCLK
        *   MOSI
        *   gen_tex
        *   inc_px
        *   inc_py
        *   reg_outs_enb
        *   debug -- emergency fallback debug if SPI is not working (or inconvenient)
    *   8 OUT:
        *   HSYNC
        *   VSYNC
        *   RGB222
    *   Bidir:
        *   io[3:0]
        *   GPOUT
        *   3 spare?? Extra RGB bits for RGB333?
*   [Per SPI spec](https://tinytapeout.com/specs/pinouts/#spi), access texture ROM via bidir pins:
    ```
    uio[0] - CSb
    uio[1] - MOSI   io0
    uio[2] - MISO   io1
    uio[3] - SCK    
    uio[4] - NC     SPARE
    uio[5] - RST    Keep high, or use as an input when no PCB
    uio[6] - WP     io2
    uio[7] - HLD    io3
    ```
    WARNING: This is [not compatible](https://tinytapeout.com/specs/pinouts/#qspi-flash-and-psram) with [Moser's QSPI Pmod](https://github.com/mole99/qspi-pmod).
    So, we could set up the bidir port as follows:
    *   Make uio[5] an input:
        *   If [SPI Pmod](https://digilent.com/reference/pmod/pmodsf3/start) is plugged in, it pulls this high.
        *   We can then sense this as "use_texture_rom" (GEN_TEXb)
        *   Also, this uio[5] input state means the chip will NOT reset (good).
        *   If Pmod is NOT plugged in, manually pull it low via 10k (?) to assert GEN_TEXb -- in fact, we could ALWAYS pull it low on the demo PCB via 47k or something so that the Pmod pull-up (10k) can override it ([3.3V CMOS or LVTTL Vih is 2.0V](https://www.fpgakey.com/wiki/details/146))
        *   If using a Pmod that leaves this NC, then pull it up manually to enable texture ROM.
    *   Reserve uio[4] for some other function (as it is normally expected to be N/C)
    *   For compat with Moser's Pmod, could we make uio[7] an input, then strap it high externally:
        *   With Moser's PMOD: we can sense this as GEN_TEXb. Moser's PMOD will see it as disabling one of the PSRAMs (?)
        *   With Digilent PMOD: Make sure the ROM is programmed with this HIGH; then when floating it is pulled up by the PMOD anyway
        *   HOWEVER: We would prefer it to behave as a "module type select" to change UIO pinouts to suit different PMODs... hmm...

```yaml
pinout:
    # Inputs:
    ui[0]: spi_sck
    ui[1]: spi_sdi # aka MOSI
    ui[2]: spi_csb # aka ss_n
    ui[3]: debug # Show debug vectors on screen?
    ui[4]: inc_px # Increment px
    ui[5]: inc_py # Increment py
    ui[6]: reg
    ui[7]: texture_pmod_type
    #NOTE: For texture_pmod_type:
    #   0=Moser's QSPI PMOD; can have a weak pull-up on uio[5] (io3), and ensure io3 bits are 1 in ROM to avoid GEN_TEXb. NOTE: Looks like there are jumpers to enable/disable the chips...?
    #   1=Digilent SPI PMOD; hence expect uio[5] (RSTb) is weakly pulled up anyway, but can be pulled low for GEN_TEXb instead.
