# Notes

*   It's been a blur since the TT04 submission. That was about a 6am finsh that "night".
*   Submission went thru fine, it seems: https://app.tinytapeout.com/projects/136
*   It got featured in the [Project Showcase](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt04/#project-showcase). Yay!
*   Since then, I've hand-made an RGB333 VGA DAC board for my DE0-Nano, and [used it as RGB222 with raybox-zero](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero/commit/b737036ce73f1fd2df42917a83dca542a71bcfc8).
*   Then I started designing a better VGA DAC board in KiCad that can support RGB888 (full 24-bit colour) but also with configuration options.

*   The design is found [here](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/tree/master/fpga/VGA-DAC).
