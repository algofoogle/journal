More Digispark stuff:

*   `USBRQ_HID_SET_REPORT` supposedly has something to do with getting keyboard LED status.
*   "[Trinket Keyboard library](https://www.instructables.com/id/DIGIKEYPAD-DigiSpark/#step9)" is also work looking into. It has [`getLEDstate()`](https://digistump.com/board/index.php?topic=1894.0).
*   Some more stuff about Digispark and keyboard LEDs here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/40337245
*   Stuff about numeric keypad and _key presses_ (i.e. `sendKeyPress` as opposed to `sendKeyStroke`): https://digistump.com/board/index.php/topic,2839.0.html -- note that it appears "pressing" a key adds it to a reported set of keys that are currently down, so naturally we could call this only up to 6 times before we'd need to release some/all keys.
*   [00a-empty] project determines minimum Digispark firmware size:
    ```
    Sketch uses 302 bytes (5%) of program storage space. Maximum is 6012 bytes.
    Global variables use 9 bytes of dynamic memory.
    ```
*   [00b-kblib] project determines minimum size when `DigiKeyboard.h` is loaded:
    ```
    Sketch uses 2490 bytes (41%) of program storage space. Maximum is 6012 bytes.
    Global variables use 81 bytes of dynamic memory.
    ```
    NOTE: [`scancode-ascii-table.h`](https://github.com/digistump/DigisparkArduinoIntegration/blob/master/libraries/DigisparkKeyboard/DigiKeyboard.h#L17) accounts for 812 program bytes, and 56 RAM bytes. The rest might be due to [`usbdrv.h`](https://github.com/digistump/DigisparkArduinoIntegration/blob/master/libraries/DigisparkKeyboard/usbdrv.h) - The [README](https://github.com/digistump/DigisparkArduinoIntegration/tree/master/libraries/DigisparkKeyboard) has some good info, as does the guts of `usbdrv.h`.
*   Read about [`PROGMEM`](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/tr/language/variables/utilities/progmem/)
*   [01-kb1] does basic keyboard stuff, but suddenly adds a lot more code (I guess because a lot of the `DigiKeyboard` class methods now have to get linked):
    ```
    Sketch uses 3388 bytes (56%) of program storage space. Maximum is 6012 bytes.
    Global variables use 83 bytes of dynamic memory.
    ```
*   Micronucleus doing an upload to Digispark seems to be finicky on macOS: With my Mac, it was faulty when plugged into the keyboard's own USB socket. When plugged into the back of the Mac, it sometimes took too long to be recognised. It still worked after a couple of tries, though. I've noticed that both Mac and Windows _look like_ they recognise the device faster if it gets plugged into a USB port that it has previously been used on.
*   For some reason, `KB.sendKeyStroke(KEY_CAPSLOCK);` seems to have no effect on my Mac. Maybe the Mac cares more about status LEDs?
*   Lots of USB key scan codes can be found here: https://gist.github.com/MightyPork/6da26e382a7ad91b5496ee55fdc73db2
*   [02-kb2] is meant to open Spotlight Search (<kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd>) and do some stuff on a Mac. In order to make that initial key combo work (`KB.sendKeyStroke(KEY_SPACE, MOD_GUI_LEFT);`) I had to add this before it:
    ```cpp
    KB.sendKeyStroke(0);
    KB.delay(100);
    KB.sendKeyStroke(0);
    KB.delay(100);
    ```
