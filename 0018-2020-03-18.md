I've been working on lots of bits of projects lately but not keeping my journal updated.

Recent stuff is [raycasting](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/tree/master/raybox), like the old Wolf3D.

So far, the basic raycaster is working in JS, with texture mapping. Some code is borrowed from [here](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) with a little bit of help from [here](https://www.playfuljs.com/a-first-person-engine-in-265-lines/).

Other ideas:

- [ ] Understand the maths and algorithms better
- [ ] [Sprites](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting3.html) - better to post-draw them using a Z buffer or 
- [ ] Better map generator
- [ ] Highlight blocks by targeting with the mouse
- [ ] Collision detection
- [ ] Trying to build a simpler version (like the "[265 lines](https://www.playfuljs.com/a-first-person-engine-in-265-lines/)" example) - this has sort of started [here](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/tree/master/raybox/simple)
- [ ] Translucency, i.e. collect translucent layers in an array, until hitting a solid, then render backwards.
- [ ] Mirrors, similar to translucency
- [ ] "Skybox" (actually more like a window)
- [ ] Mouse locking
