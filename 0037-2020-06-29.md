`test07d` modified:
*   Simplified char ROM code/logic.
*   Added support for hex digits to char ROM.
*   Counter is now 6 digits: Lowest 2 count frames 0..63 in hex; next 3 are decimal and tick over every 64 frames; highest is a continuation, but counts in hex. Hence, highest reading can be `F9993F` before it rolls over to `000000`.
*   How close can we get to 64Hz with our current clock? Take 25MHz, divide by 64, and then divide by these horizontal values to get close to good vertical values:
    | Divide by... | ...lines | ...rounded Hz |
    |-|-|-|
    | 772 | 505.99 | 63.9989Hz |
    | 775 | 504.03 | 64.0041Hz |
    | 789 | 495.09 | 64.0115Hz |
    | 786 | 496.98 | 63.9972Hz |
*   Should try using a flexible carry-based BCD counter: https://www.element14.com/community/groups/fpga-group/blog/2014/10/12/seven-segment-bcd-counter-using-the-valentfx-logi-edu

Project ideas for next test:
*   Move a cursor on the screen in X and Y. Left button increments X, right button increments Y, both have wrap-around.
*   Simulate acceleration and deceleration using inertia counters.
*   Keyboard or keypad input, or even RS-232, to make things more interesting.
*   Interfacing with SRAM for video bitmap image.
