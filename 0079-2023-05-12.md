# Raybox

## Accomplishments

*   Fixed larger column heights (scan scale up to 511 height now instead of 240).
*   Got texture mapping to work in a synthesisable way by shifting the height scaler reciprocal
    out of tracer and into raybox. The texture itself is not in the design yet, though:
    the memory is, but there's no way to write to it (except faking it via the sim).

# Notes

*   Is there a way we could do some sort of hardware interpolation while rendering upscaled textures?
*   Now that we've changed to storing vdist instead of height, there is some slightly noticeable
    up/down wobble in the textures as we move, I guess because now the texture calculation varies
    on a sub-pixel level rather than just coming directly from a consistent column height.
    Is there a way to stabilise this? e.g. drop a bit or so of precision after the reciprocal?
*   We maybe don't need to store a full 16 bits per column trace distance. I only selected that
    to accommodate 7 bits for integer part going up to ~91, and fractional part doing down to
    1/512. Precision really only needs to be ~9 bits, though (because height on screen ranges
    from 1..511). We then need an exponent, and together both the exponent and mantissa *could*
    already be calculated (for free?) by the reciprocal logic... or at least we can use the LZC.
    *   Assume an unsigned mantissa of 9 bits, and an unsigned exponent of 3 bits (12 bits total):
        *   `E=0, M=xxxxxxxxx` is our precision: `000'0000.xxxx'xxxx'x`
        *   `E=0, M=000000001` is the smallest possible value: `000'0000.0000'0000'1` = 1/512
        *   `E=7, M=111111111` is the largest possible value: `111'1111.1100'0000'0` = 127.75
*   When using a reciprocal that doesn't have matched M and N, would it make sense to flip the
    M and N values for the output? Not quite:
    *   Reciprocal of 000.0000001 (Q3.7) is 10000000.000 which clearly won't fit in Q3.7, and instead requires Q8.x.
    *   However, compare this with 111.0000001 (897), whose reciprocal is 0.0000000001001001000011... (0.00111482720...)
