# GFMPW-1 bring-up (continued)

I've put test firmware into subdirectories of [algofoogle-multi-caravel/firmware/](https://github.com/algofoogle/algofoogle-multi-caravel/tree/gf180/firmware).

These subdirectories (e.g. [./basic_blink/](https://github.com/algofoogle/algofoogle-multi-caravel/tree/gf180/firmware/basic_blink)) should be copied into a clone of [caravel_board](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_board), nested within `/firmware/gf180/`.

You can then make and flash one to your Caravel board by doing (say):

```bash
cd firmware/gf180/basic_blink
make clean flash
```

Tests done:
*   mux_test design 13: `MUX_DESIGN=13 make clean flash`:
    *   Verified IO[31:16] outputs `0101010110101010`
*   mux_test design 14: `MUX_DESIGN=14 make clean flash`:
    *   Verified IO[31:16] outputs `1010101101010101`
*   mux_test design 11: `MUX_DESIGN=11 make clean flash`:
    *   Verified that IO[30:24] follow IO[37:31]
    *   Verified that IO[23:8] follow `la_data_in[23:8]`
*   mux_test design 12: `MUX_DESIGN=12 make clean flash`:
    *   Measured IO[31:8]:
        ```
        31:30   r_mux_io5_reset_enb     zz          (Verilog error: configured as INPUTS)
        29      io5_reset               z           (Verilog error: configured as INPUT)
        28      sys_reset               0           sys_reset not currently asserted (disabled anyway)

        21:20   r_mux_sel3              11          ...Select design 1100 (12)
        19:18   r_mux_sys_reset_enb     11          Disable wb_rst_i
        17:16   r_mux_auto_reset_enb    00          Enable "auto-reset non-selected designs"
        15:8    i_design_reset          11111111    Manually hold all designs in reset anyway
        ```
    *   There's an ERROR in the Verilog: [only top 6 bits](https://github.com/algofoogle/algofoogle-multi-caravel/blob/19251b1d9f929e2b2e8c169404437b8a2398560e/verilog/rtl/mux/top_design_mux.v#L416) should be configured as inputs, [but 9 bits are](https://github.com/algofoogle/algofoogle-multi-caravel/blob/19251b1d9f929e2b2e8c169404437b8a2398560e/verilog/rtl/mux/top_design_mux.v#L411), so IO[31:29] are INPUTS instead of outputs. This doesn't affect the operation of the mux or overall chip... it just affects this one test.
    *   NOTE: We could probably work around this by writing firmware to override IO[31:29] from BIDIR to OUTPUT.
*   trzf_test: `make clean flash`:
    *   gpout[2:0] present clk,clk/2,clk/4 as expected.
    *   GPIO[9:8] seems to present VSYNC,HSYNC as expected.
    *   GPIO[15:10] look like they could be expected RGB data.
    *   GPIO[16] looks like expected texture CSB signal.
    *   GPIO[17] looks like texture SCLK.
    *   GPIO[18] appears to have a valid QSPI read command and address pattern.

# Control board options

I'd like a board that can be used to help test my GFMPW-1 chips, i.e. act as a universal testbench.

Requirements are:
*   Minimum of 32 GPIOs, but ideally at least 36: 32 are used by Diego's design, 2 are for a UART interface to a host PC, and ideally we'd also control Caravel's CLK and RESETb.
*   All GPIOs should be at least 5-5.5V-tolerant, but ideally natively 5V.
*   At least a 10MHz clock, but 40-50MHz would be better.
*   Ideally should be PC-controlled, though it's acceptable to just be driven by its own firmware.

Options include:
*   Arduino Mega 2560 (based on ATMega2560):
    *   5-volt native
    *   54 GPIOs
    *   16MHz
    *   PWM & UART
    *   Interrupts
    *   1x SPI
*   Older Arduino Mega -- basically the same?? Slightly fewer peripherals/storage?
*   Android Open ADK (Accessories Development Kit) -- based on Arduino Mega 2560?
*   XC9572XL, or 144/288 variants? Available in larger pin counts. 5V-tolerant (but not native).
*   STM32F103
    *   STM32F103R* (64-pin) looks like it has 31 5V-tolerant GPIOs
    *   STM32F103V* (100-pin) looks like it has 60.
    *   STM32F103Z* (144-pin) looks like it has 89.
*   Anything with suitable bi-directional level shifters, inc. OBLS
*   2 or more MCUs linked?
*   89C52 has 32 GPIOs
*   These (for example) all have internal Flash and run at up to 5.5V:
    | Part              | ISA           | MHz   | Price | IO count |
    |-|-|-|-|-|
    | PIC18F46Q10T-I/PT | ?             | 64MHz | $2.21 | 36       |
    | PIC18F55Q43-I/PT  | ?             | 64MHz | $2.65 | 44       |
    | CY8C4246AZI-M443  | ARM Cortex-M0 | 48MHz | $2.25 | 38       |
    | NUC029LAN         | ARM Cortex-M0 | 72MHz | $2.44 | 40       |
    | NUC123SD4AN0      | ARM Cortex-M0 | 72MHz | $3.74 | 47       |

# More testing of GFMPW-1...

For some notes on testing and actually seeing raybox-zero (top_raybox_zero_fsm, or just "trzf") running on GFMPW-1, see the next journal: [0220](./0220-2024-10-11.md)
