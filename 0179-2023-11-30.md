# Quick update re GFMPW-1 attempts

*   Put MPW9's `~/.bashrc` env var extensions into a separate script.
*   Alias (function) for `git clone git@github.com:algofoogle/`
*   More TIPs (and links) for handy setup stuff including improving MPW9 VM, initial setup guides, etc.
*   Try to create a bad design that fails timing requirements, even using a wide in/out bus for the macro.
*   Make all of the raybox-zero parts more modular (macros) to really stress-test them but also make them individually testable in an MPW.
*   Remove all debug stuff
