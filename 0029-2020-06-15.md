*   Started working on [fpga4fun.com tutorials](https://www.fpga4fun.com/MusicBox1.html), implementing [`test05a`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/tree/master/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05a):
    *   25-bit counter attached to 50MHz clock.
    *   Divides down (at bit 16) to about 381Hz, fed out to loudspeaker in series with 1k&ohm; resistor.
    *   Divides down (at bit 24) to about 1.5Hz, which blinks `LED_Left`.
    *   Also sets `LED_Right` to logical OR of the pushed states of both pushbuttons.
    *   Demonstrates `test05a` top module which uses all of the board's nets, and links with `music` module.
    *   It works!
    *   **NOTE:** Standard 8&ohm; speaker is connected to FB2-3 (pin 58) in series with a 1k&ohm; resistor.
*   Made [`test05b`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/master/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05b):
    *   Based on 2nd part of the above tutorial.
    *   Uses `define` statements.
    *   Uses ternary operators.
    *   Lets the frequency be controlled to 1 of 4 defined notes via push-buttons.
    *   Left LED is unused (will be dimly lit due to `KPR`).
    *   Right LED is `AND` of pressed state of left and right buttons.
    *   Implements pushbutton states as a 2-bit signal and compares with integers.
    *   It works!
*   Made [`test05c`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/master/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05c):
    *   1st part of [tutorial part 2](https://www.fpga4fun.com/MusicBox2.html).
    *   Plays alternating 440Hz and 880Hz tones, switching at 1.5Hz.
    *   Makes use of "[dot-named module arguments](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/8d2e9c96b14a3e22ca001e428a18f2a992b18bc9/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05c/test05c.v#L12)" to help identify them more clearly.
    *   Also treats the 2 buttons and 2 LEDs as "[vectors](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/8d2e9c96b14a3e22ca001e428a18f2a992b18bc9/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05c/test05c.v#L5-L6)" (is that the correct term?), mapped [via the UCF](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/8d2e9c96b14a3e22ca001e428a18f2a992b18bc9/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05c/test05c.ucf#L4-L10).
    *   It works!
    *   **NOTE:** As of this example, the speaker/resistor is now connected to FB2-2 (pin 60) because it is available on all XC9572XL package sizes.
*   Made [`test05d`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/master/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05d):
    *   2nd part of [tutorial part 2](https://www.fpga4fun.com/MusicBox2.html).
    *   Plays a tone that ramps up and down from about 766Hz to 1526Hz, at about 3Hz.
    *   Now it's [prescaling the clock in the top module](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/18c67f921a29d39039882ef256f2d6752a34288f/fpga/XC9572XL/test05/t05d/test05d.v#L10-L12).
    *   It works!

## Notes

*   What happens if assigning a big value to a too-small counter?
    *   Evidently, synthesis/fit doesn't care. It won't raise any warnings that I can see. It must just use the bits that fit.
