# Accomplishments

## raybox-bridge

*   Mouse rotation now implemented. It seems to work in combo with WASD keys, now.
    I disabled a bunch of other stuff left over from vga_cursor.
*   `Player` class can do conversion of vectors in fixed point, and these values now
    send in the "tick" handler via PicoDeo's `/rbvectors` command.
    SPI receiver not yet implemented in Raybox design.

# Next steps

*   Implement Raybox SPI receiver for `/rbvectors` data.
*   Consider keys that offer a way to "muck" with vectors, e.g. non-orthographic,
    pushing them outside their normal range. Examples:
    *   "Wobble" vplane (skew it) left and right rapidly or otherwise stretch/squash it
        to create hallucination/watery effect.
    *   Expand vplane substantially to create pull-out stretch effect.

# Notes

*   If we want to reduce the no. of bits needed for SPI (and register storage in general)
    then for each of these vectors we only need:
    *   Player: Reduce from Q12.12 to Q7.12: 6 bits for map pos 0..63, with 1 for sign.
        Sign shouldn't actually be needed, and note that while technically the map range
        is `0.0 <= x < 64.0`, in reality there should be an outer wall that confines us
        to `1.0 <= x < 63.0` (or in fact less due to clipping). Consider, though, that
        a creative designer might like to be able to do map edge overflow, but also that
        we can actually get what we want for the range because `0x3F.FFF` is *nearly*
        64.0, and when it rolls over to `0x40.000` we're basically at 0 anyway, so walking
        thru the map edge should be fine if a designer really wants that...?
    *   Facing: Reduce from Q12.12 to Q2.12. This will allow a range of `-2.0 <= x < 2.0`
        and typically we don't need values with a magnitude exceeding 1.0 anyway (unless
        there's some design reason to support it).
    *   Vplane: Reduce from Q12.12 to Q4.12. This will allow a range of `-8.0 <= x < 8.0`
        which would be an FOV of `2*atan(8.0)` or ~165.75&deg; which is extreme.
    *   HENCE, total bits to transfer, shadow, or store reduces from 144 to 98.
