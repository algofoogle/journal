## Notes

*   My XC9572XL breakout boards should arrive from JLCPCB today or tomorrow.
*   I have most (all?) of the parts needed to assemble the boards to a working state.
*   More parts are still arriving from element14, and hopefully will be here before the end of the week. Shouldn't stop me, though.
*   Try soldering with junk TQFP first. See how hard it is to avoid bridging. Lift one from an existing board if necessary.
*   I should test XC9500 CPLD stuff with my Dangerous Prototypes board first, to verify a working version, before I test my own.
*   When assembling, laying down all but the TQFP will allow for safe testing of the PSU, LEDs, and buttons. Maybe also the XO.
*   Can also test the bridge board with spacers.
*   Need to go thru my New Shed Catalogue list *and* my IC list to see if there are any more caches of parts buried somewhere.
*   Also need to go thru my eBay purchase history to see if I can account for everything.
*   Need to fix FFC for Chris.
*   I want to try making some more PCBs with JLCPCB. If I gang up orders, the shipping should be cheaper...?
    Try thru-hole, SMD (inc. soldering practice), mousebite "cheats", routing, adapters for strange connectors, ENIG/edge, and PCB assembly. What about 4-layer boards and thin/FPC boards too, castellation, and solder paste?
*   Info on 5V programmable logic, specific to NESDev stuff: http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=17247

## Other PCB ideas

Some PCB ideas could be to try out JLCPCB assembly, too, depending on their available parts.

Goal for designing some of these boards is: (a) more practice inc. layout but also testing JLC; (b) more projects; (c) having more to order in one go, to combine shipping.

*   Minimal Z80 or 6502 test board.
*   Clone someone else's board, even something like a ZX80.
*   Tester for fine pitch, big package, BGA, whatever.
*   Something that doesn't require too much circuit design. More about layout and assembly.
*   ESP8266 device.
*   Device with multiple power conversions inc. Mains SMPS.
*   Something to simplify what would otherwise be a large amount of wiring, esp. flip adaptors, etc.
*   Multi-project board, e.g. as a breakout or device to use with any MCU.
*   Electronic dice with combinatorial logic and roll-down.
*   NES board with a hole cut in it to "drop in" (under) an STM32 Blue Pill and solder through with "fake castellation". Either use drilled holes, or "edge connector". Could also be used with a splayed-out DIP socket.
*   Shorter NES board, closer to the specs of a Famicom adapter, with ability to use the middle hole for the plug-in board.
