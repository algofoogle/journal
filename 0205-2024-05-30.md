# Very rough update for a few different days of experimentation

Assume raybox-zero versions:
*   1.0: TT04
*   1.3: EW (CI2311)
*   1.4: GFMPW-1
*   1.5: Upcoming TT07 version with conditional compilation added on top of 1.4

# Doing TT07 with 1.5

*   Tried fixing GHA test artefact storage
*   Updated `src/raybox-zero` to `@gf180-with-tests`
*   Wired up `project.v` with new `rbzero` ports
*   Changed `uo_out`s to match Tiny VGA PMOD and updated `tb.v` to suit.
*   For now there is no texture ROM support, and `i_gen_tex` is hard-coded to 1. Some other features aren't yet mapped to pins e.g. map overlay, trace overlay (not working; needs an `` `ifdef `` fix).

# Harden

```bash
source ./tt07-env.sh # Should load tt07 venv too.
./tt/tt_tool.py --create-user-config
time ./tt/tt_tool.py --harden # It took only 5 minutes! How is that possible?
./tt/tt_tool.py --print-warnings
./tt/tt_tool.py --print-stats
```

| Utilisation (%) | Wire length (um) |

# GDS render

```bash
./tt/tt_tool.py --create-svg
rsvg-convert --unlimited gds_render.svg -s <(echo 'text{display:none;}') -o gds_render_png24.png --no-keep-image-data
xdg-open gds_render_png24.png
```

# Simulate

```bash
cd test
cp ../runs/wokwi/results/final/verilog/gl/tt_um_algofoogle_raybox_zero.v gate_level_netlist.v
make clean clean_frames && make -B GATES=yes
```

```

*   Finish:
    *   Do final GL sim
    *   PR for 1.5-dev
    *   Doco
    *   Do actual submission
    *   Test on FPGA
*   SPI2 can turn on trace debug & map overlay
*   Option to flip the display (for clockwise rotation or mirroring)
*   Optional VGA output switching inc. to match TT04, my boards, and Matt's clock version
*   Anything else that is fun to put on-screen?
    *   Why not a basic sprite?

# tt-vga-fun stuff

*   Harden digital block again. See how big it is now.
*   Work out where I was up to with dacboost and see if I can lay it out.
*   Extract dacboost (and full design) and simulate: I recall I was writing notes about doing this in a previous journal or my phone's 'Notes'? See how much current it uses.
*   Do check for those old notes, some might've been important, e.g. making sure line debug bits are not full brightness (or gating) during full pass-thru mode!
*   Try some pass gates to switch between buffered/not
*   Put buffers on the INPUTS to the DACs -- standard cells or just big double-inverters?

## Hardening

Change `config.json` to initially use relative sizing, to see how much area we need. Note that max is about 160x220um.

```bash
source ./tt07-env.sh  # Sets some vars but also loads venv.
source ./openlane/controller/env.sh # WHAT I USED LAST TIME.
#NOTE: $PDK_ROOT now has this from 2024-04-19:
# /home/anton/antonOL/pdk
# ...and that contains: sky130A -> volare/sky130/versions/cd1748bb197f9b7af62a54507de6624e30363943/sky130A
time make harden
```

Harden takes about 2 minutes with 4 cores. Succeeds with no warnings. It wants 136x136um; that's doable. Could probably make it smaller, though. It's currently configured with `"FP_CORE_UTIL": 50`.

```bash
make update_files
```

PL_TARGET_DENSITY: Can make logic densely packed, despite large area.
FP_CORE_UTIL: Sizes core relative to amount of logic.

These work OK and get an area of 117x117um:
```json
    "FP_CORE_UTIL": 75,
    "PL_TARGET_DENSITY": 0.85,
```

Let's try a different aspect:
```json
    "FP_SIZING": "absolute",
    "DIE_AREA": "0 0 150 95",
    "FP_CORE_UTIL": 80,
    "PL_TARGET_DENSITY": 0.86,
```

It fits, but takes 6mins now and gets fanouts (6/4).

```bash
cd mag
mkdir OLD
git mv sky130_fd_sc_hd__* OLD/
git mv sky130_ef_sc_hd__* OLD/
rm controller.gds
rm controller.mag
```

# Tidying vim backup/swap/undo files:

*   `mkdir ~/.vimdata/config`
*   Create ~/.vimdata/config/backunswap.vimrc:

    ```vimrc
    " https://vi.stackexchange.com/a/21709:
    let &directory = expand('~/.vimdata/swap//')

    set backup
    let &backupdir = expand('~/.vimdata/backup//')

    set undofile
    let &undodir = expand('~/.vimdata/undo//')

    if !isdirectory(&undodir) | call mkdir(&undodir, "p") | endif
    if !isdirectory(&backupdir) | call mkdir(&backupdir, "p") | endif
    if !isdirectory(&directory) | call mkdir(&directory, "p") | endif
    ```
*   Include it in `~/.vimrc`:
    ```vimrc
    " https://vi.stackexchange.com/a/21709:
    source ~/.vimdata/config/backunswap.vimrc
    ```

Vim junk files are now all confined to subdirs in `~/.vimdata/`



# tt-vga-fun didn't make it in to TT07

At least I still have raybox-zero.

Here's where I'm up to:

`maybe` branch has lots of mucking around with current steering.

`xschem/bdac.sch` is the best current steering DAC I was able to come up with that didn't use too much area and probably is OK with current on a resistor.

Miller capacitance?

Maybe I should try LVT/ZVT FETs.

# TT08 analog

*   Find out how tt08-analog-template is different from tt06 -- esp. the template DEF
*   How about matt's analog instructions? I know the Makefile has been updated


# TT04 testing

VGA output mapping:

| uo_out | raybox-zero   | PMOD | VGA J1 | VGA J2 |
|--------|---------------|-----:|-------:|-------:|
| OUT0   | `hsync_n`     | 1    |        |      7 |
| OUT1   | `vsync_n`     | 2    |        |      8 |
| OUT2   | `red[0]`      | 3    |      3 |        |
| OUT3   | `red[1]`      | 4    |      4 |        |
| GND    | GND           | 5    |      5 |        |
| VCC3V3 | VCC3V3        | 6    |      6 |        |
| OUT4   | `green[0]`    | 7    |        |      3 |
| OUT5   | `green[1]`    | 8    |        |      4 |
| OUT6   | `blue[0]`     | 9    |      9 |        |
| OUT7   | `blue[1]`     | 10   |     10 |        |
| GND    | GND           | 11   |        |        |
| VCC3V3 | VCC3V3        | 12   |        |        |

Average MicroPython POV transmit time is 53ms when using 25.179MHz (core clock 101MHz)

At 31.5MHz (core clock 126MHz) this is reduced to 43us

The extra overhead of converting floating point POVs and sending them pieces appears to be about 3ms
