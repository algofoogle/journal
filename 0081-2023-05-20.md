# Raybox

## Accomplishments

*   Updated sprite: Easy one; I added `utils/asset_tool` to help with conversion from PNG to HEX.
    Some sprite colours currently come out too intense (or with too much contrast) on my VGA display.
*   Improved rendering of first sprite.
*   Tracer FSM optimised a bit.

## Thoughts

*   If we "share" the reciprocal and multipliers in the tracer, it'd probably pipeline
    in parallel pretty well without taking up too much additional area.
*   For sprites that are static and fixed in the centre of their map cell,
    is it possible to somehow optimise the ray casting to more-efficiently
    include their data in the trace buffer?
    *   This could even be used for sprites where we can KNOW (by map designer)
        that the sprite will never be able to have something besides a wall BEHIND it.

## Next steps

This list is mostly the same throughout the days/weeks, but occasionally I update it to look at the bits I care
about most right now, or which seem like lowest-hanging fruit at the time:

*   Fix sprite limit of 512-wide (8&times; scaling), i.e. 256-half-width.
*   Check sprite texture coord wrapping glitch.
*   Try sprite rotation experiment: Idea to take original Wolf3D sprite rotations, and use something like
    Premiere Pro transforms/perspective to "interpolate" rotations and see if it improves the effect.
*   Make RGB222 VGA plug
*   Get full 640w working instead of 512w. Also, what about trying Wolf3D's slightly taller aspect from
    320x200, i.e. stretch vertically by +20% (240/200) or compress horizontally by the same. With Wolf3D's
    aspect, scaling vertical 200 to 480 is &times;2.4, so 2.4&times;320 = 768-equivalent.
    This could be achieved just by changing FOV (i.e. vplane magnitude).


## Later

*   Try changing map to 32x32; give the tracer a workout.
*   Add extra wall IDs to the map.
*   Fix texture wrap glitch (occasional single wrapped pixel at top or bottom of columns)
    that is possibly due to reciprocal accuracy. Either clip the height by 1 dummy pixel *after*
    texel calculations are done, or just clamp texture coords.
*   Figure out how to send data to the FPGA from the host PC. Otherwise, try other input sources,
    whether FPGA interfacing (3.3V-safely) with PS/2 keyboard and mouse, or quadrature encoder,
    or Arduino, or whatever.
*   Work on "game" constroller MCU: Arduino, STM32, ESP8266, or ESP32?
*   Learn more about Makefiles and working with projects in subdirectories and multiple targets.
    Use case: Raybox utilities in `utils/`, inc. some shared code.

# Notes

*   Side-by-side visual diff using `git difftool` configured to use `vimdiff`:
    https://diethardsteiner.github.io/git/2021/01/07/Git-Visual-Side-By-Side-Diffs.html
*   Different bit packing in Verilog memory files (`.hex`, `.mem`, `.bit`, etc. along with
    `$readmemh`, `$readmemb`, etc.): https://projectf.io/posts/initialize-memory-in-verilog/
