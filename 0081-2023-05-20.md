*   For sprites that are static and fixed in the centre of their map cell,
    is it possible to somehow optimise the ray casting to more-efficiently
    include their data in the trace buffer?
    *   This could even be used for sprites where we can KNOW (by map designer)
        that the sprite will never be able to have something besides a wall BEHIND it.
