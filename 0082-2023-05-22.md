# Raybox

## Achievements

*   Sprite can now get as close as 0.5, i.e. 16x scaling.
    Note that this is actually 1.0 away from the sprite's centre.
    Getting closer starts to clip the sprites right edge.
    We could get this down to a distance of 0.25 by probably adding an
    extra bit, but this doesn't seem necessary.
    For Wolf3D, it seems the player must be more distant from a blocking actor than that.
*   Full 640-width now works.

## Next

*   Use KiCad to design a RGB222 VGA plug, and optionally a big adapter that works for DE0-Nano
    (and could allow it to interface with an ISA card).
*   Try changing map to 32x32; give the tracer a workout.
*   Add extra wall IDs to the map.


## Thoughts

*   Our walk speed is much slower than actual Wolf3D.
    Wolf3D walk speed feels like it is approx. twice as fast.
*   Wolf3D player "radius" is 22528 units. Treated as Q16.16, this in binary is `0.1011`,
    or 0.34375 units (i.e. divide 22528 by 65536). Thus, the player cannot be fewer than
    this number of units from a wall, which is about the same as what Raybox can
    render... this seems to match the 512-scaler's limits.
*   Need to detect tracer overrun.
*   Try a bigger map.
*   FOV can be changed pretty easily by changing the vplane vector length, but
    it is tuned (coincidentally??) to the sprite width, which uses a 1:1 aspect
    ratio currently.
