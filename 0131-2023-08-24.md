# raybox-zero: Improving the FSM

## Next steps

1.  Get a cell/area count at 4x2 tiles before making any further changes. Try for these variations:
    1.  25MHz/new-OpenLane/SYNTH_STRATEGY=4
    2.  50MHz/new-OpenLane/SYNTH_STRATEGY=4
    3.  50MHz/old-OpenLane/default
    4.  50MHz/new-OpenLane/default -- *should fail due to yosys-abc bug*
    5.  Repeat the above for 8x2 tiles too, because our design area *might* blow out in these subsequent steps.
2.  Repeat the above 5 (actually 8) steps for each of these following steps -- maybe in some of them, the yosys-abc bug will be hidden?
3.  Implement SPI access to `pov`, or even byte-wide access, because we need to see if this blows out the floorplan (e.g. by preventing logic reduction in the reciprocal and other multipliers). Assuming it's OK, implement use of it in the sim, too. [**DONE** in 0135](./0135-2023-08-28.md#fixed-pov-spi-7aae611) -- it no longer fits in 4x2, but hopefully the improvements below will then help...
4.  Implement reciprocal sharing in `wall_tracer`, and prove that it works... i.e. both that `make clean_sim` still works as expected (hopefully also when `pov` is being sent rotated views), and that it can synth.
5.  Move `height_scaler` reciprocal into `wall_tracer` FSM.


## Results from step 1 above

NOTE: These results are numbered per the variations above (with 5..8 being for 8x2 tiles instead of 4x2).

To respectively get:
*   cells_pre_abc, TotalCells, max speed
*   logic cells
*   utilisation and wires

...I run these 3:
```bash
summary.py --design . --run 0 --caravel --full-summary | egrep 'pre_abc|clock_freq|TotalCells'
./tt/tt_tool.py --print-cell-category | fgrep 'total cells'
./tt/tt_tool.py --print-stats
```

    *   Utilisation: 25.8%
    *   Wires: 246,738um
3.  yosys-abc fails.
    *   cells_pre_abc: 18,478
4.  yosys-abc fails.
    *   cells_pre_abc: 18,675

Note that I could previously get it to work when using the old OpenLane image (`cb59d1f`) and no SYNTH_STRATEGY=4 override, but it doesn't work anymore, probably due to a subtlety introduced from me needing to change unsized constants (e.g. from `0` to `1'b0`).

## Later

1.  Remove redundant `map_rom`. Note that this will require sharing the one remaining instance between `map_overlay` and `wall_tracer`. This probably means either delaying trace start until after the screen region where `map_overlay` masters it, or maybe pre-loading the current stripe of map_overlay data into registers...?
2.  Test that the design works on FPGA.
3.  Start thinking about TB.
4.  Work on sharing more resources, even if just where they can be spread out in the `wall_tracer` FSM, and see if this reduces cells/area.
5.  See if `needStepX` can just be replaced with a different state, or if there are other states we can merge for better cycle efficiency?
