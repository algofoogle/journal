Quick update for test005 run last night: Shared multiplier is a winner?

### test005: Trying shared multiplier for trackInit

<details><summary>Click for details...</summary>

Code:
*   tt04-raybox-zero: [`70f1a6c`](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt04-raybox-zero/commit/70f1a6c?diff=split): harden_test: Minor update to change parameter order
    *   Equivalent to: [`7aae611`](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt04-raybox-zero/commit/7aae6113ba657507045dc5032e27ae59020a8336?diff=split): Wire up SPI for fixed pov
*   src/raybox-zero: [`69f4dca`](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero/commit/69f4dca?diff=split): test005: Trying shared multiplier for trackInit
    *   Modified? **(M src/raybox-zero)**
    *   Equivalent to: [``](): ?

Summary:
*   test005 branches off test002 (Registered visualWallDist avoids post-subtraction) because this one seems to have the best performance so far (even if by a tiny margin).
*   Where we had this:
    ```verilog
    wire `F2 trackInitX = stepDistX * partialX;
    wire `F2 trackInitY = stepDistY * partialY;
    ```
    ...it is now a single shared multiplier, driven by state, i.e. with mutiplicand and multiplier inputs selected by a mux on `state`...
    ```verilog
    wire `F mul_in_a = (state==TracePrepX) ? stepDistX : stepDistY;
    wire `F mul_in_b = (state==TracePrepX) ?  partialX :  partialY;
    wire `F2 mul_out = mul_in_a * mul_in_b;
    ```
    ...and result being written to `trackDistX` and `trackDistY` respectively:
    ```verilog
    TracePrepX:
        ...
        trackDistX <= `FF(mul_out);
        ...
    TracePrepY:
        ...
        trackDistY <= `FF(mul_out);
        ...
    ```

Findings:
*   **4x2:4 fits, but doesn't reach 50MHz** (gets closer though)
*   Speed isn't necessarily better, but area is much better at 48.86% for **4x2:5**
*   Overall, shared multiplier seems to be a winner, and makes a notable difference for just reducing from 2 to 1.

## Next Steps

*   Try texture mapping (i.e. bring back `tex`, and set up other addends) using shared multiplier too.
*   See if we can do something with shared multiplier for `reciprocal` too.
*   Try reducing size of shared multiplier.
