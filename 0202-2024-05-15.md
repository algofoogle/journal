# Full layout simulation of tt06-grab-bag

I want to try running a full SPICE simulation of the layout I submitted to TT06, including SPICE simulation of the embedded digital block. This will hopefully give a better idea of how well the 24-bit digital drivers into the DACs will work, and hence the expected output of the DACs, including parasitics from all wires, etc.

NOTE: In doing this, I should also check currents, e.g. load on power rails, and probably also on DAC resistors.

I did it as shown below, using my `tt-vga-fun` repo because [at this point in time](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/tree/d07a6ffee786001e7e046bb78fc192ee55ad76c1) it still is using the exact layout I submitted to TT06, and the sim will be done from extraction of that layout only.

1.  Full SPICE extraction of the entire design layout:
    ```bash
    cd mag
    #NOTE: No PROJECT_NAME=... prefix needed as Makefile already specifies 'tt_um_algofoogle_tt06_grab_bag'
    make tt_um_algofoogle_tt06_grab_bag.sim.spice
    ```
    This produces a 6.5MB `tt_um_algofoogle_tt06_grab_bag.sim.spice` file. Note that I saw the following warning about "`current technology is "minimum"   Sourcing design .magicrc for technology sky130A ...`"... I think this is OK.
2.  Took Matt's [`full_spice_sim.cir`](https://github.com/mattvenn/tt06-analog-r2r-dac/blob/main/sim/full_spice_sim.cir), blending it with aspects of my [`mixed.cir`](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/main/sim/mixed.cir) to try and make a suitable testbench.

    See [my `full_spice_sim.cir`](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/d07a6ffee786001e7e046bb78fc192ee55ad76c1/sim/full_spice_sim.cir).

3.  Tried an initial simulation and found it took way too long, but I managed to improve it by fiddling with more things...
4.  I built the latest version of ngspice ("ngspice-42+"):
    ```bash
    sudo apt install libomp-dev  # Not sure this is actually required.
    cd ~
    git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/ngspice/ngspice ngspice-source
    cd ngspice-source
    chmod a+x compile_linux.sh
    sudo ./compile_linux.sh
    ```
    NOTE: This should build *and install* the latest commit of ngspice (`b2c0f85c6d62433a651c9cff75668501199f43bb`? Commit dates are out of order, and most *recent* appears to be `44d0991af04dc6b1bdc52cbd7b52e0aae98ebff6`).
5.  [I created a `.spiceinit`](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/d07a6ffee786001e7e046bb78fc192ee55ad76c1/sim/.spiceinit) which is based on [ngspice's recommendations for sky130](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/applic.html#sky). This might be outdated, or it might be the most recent recommendation; I don't know. It includes info about ngspice-42 (which is pretty recent):
    ```spice
    echo Using tt-vga-fun/sim/.spiceinit
    set ngbehavior=hsa     ; set compatibility for reading PDK libs
    set skywaterpdk        ; skip some checks for faster lib loading
    set ng_nomodcheck      ; don't check the model parameters
    set num_threads=14     ; CPU processor cores available
    set xtrtol=10
    option noinit          ; don't print operating point data
    option klu             ; select KLU as matrix solver
    optran 0 0 0 100p 2n 0 ; don't use dc operating point, but transient op
    ```
    Note also that I've configured it to use 14 threads (out of my total of 16 vCPUs in the VM I'm using). It seems to use one core at 100%, and the rest at about 15~22%.

    Overall, I found this combination runs much faster than my initial attempt (in point 3). It's still slow, but at least it can do a full VGA line in about 8 hours (rather than what would've been more like 30 hours, I think).
6.  To actually run the simulation:
    ```bash
    ngspice full_spice_sim.cir
    ```
    ...or now use my Makefile:
    ```bash
    time make cleanfull
    ```

## More notes on SPICE for full extraction simulation

My extracted `tt_um_algofoogle_tt06_grab_bag.sim.spice` seems to have the ports in a bit of a funny order:
```spice
.subckt tt_um_algofoogle_tt06_grab_bag_parax
+ clk
+ ena
+ rst_n
+ ua[3]
+ ua[4]
+ ua[5]
+ ua[6]
+ ua[7]
+ ui_in[1]
+ ui_in[6]
+ uio_in[0]
+ uio_in[1]
...
```

Note that it adds the suffix `_parax` (which I think comes from Matt's Makefile).

Note also that my first simulation attempt was EXTREMELY slow (from memory it took hours to simulate just a few microseconds), it was eating huge amounts of RAM, and generating massive `.raw` files. I optimised this a bit. Read on...

These are the things I did in my `full_spice_sim.cir`:
*   [Included lines](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/d07a6ffee786001e7e046bb78fc192ee55ad76c1/sim/full_spice_sim.cir#L11-L14) which attempt to disable mismatch simulation and Monte Carlo, but I know neither whether this is a good idea, or makes any difference on performance, or even if they are correctly taking effect as expected:
    ```spice
    * Disable mismatch:
    .param mc_mm_switch=0
    * Disable Monte Carlo:
    .param mc_pr_switch=0
    ```
*   [Matched the weird port ordering](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/d07a6ffee786001e7e046bb78fc192ee55ad76c1/sim/full_spice_sim.cir#L16-L71) of my overall TT tile layout (from extraction, as mentioned above), but also created port names with no brackets (just in case):
    ```spice
    xtt
    + clk
    + ena
    + rst_n
    + ua3
    + ua4
    + ua5
    + ua6
    + ua7
    + ui_in1
    + ui_in6
    + uio_in0
    + uio_in1
    ...
    ```
*   [Added estimated TT pin loading](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/d07a6ffee786001e7e046bb78fc192ee55ad76c1/sim/full_spice_sim.cir#L73-L79).
*   [Used 1.8V throughout](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/d07a6ffee786001e7e046bb78fc192ee55ad76c1/sim/full_spice_sim.cir#L84-L85) in contrast to Matt using 3.3V in some cases. I expect 1.8V matches actual VCC and digital inputs on-chip.
*   [Tried an example](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/d07a6ffee786001e7e046bb78fc192ee55ad76c1/sim/full_spice_sim.cir#L108-L116) of pass-thru mode (my VGA controller's "mode 0") alternating between high and low analog outputs on alternating pixels by using `h0/p0` in the MSB. Commented out for now. Seemed to work (and slews were bad, as expected).
*   [Set up the test to do the "mode 3" (XOR) test](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/d07a6ffee786001e7e046bb78fc192ee55ad76c1/sim/full_spice_sim.cir#L118-L126) for its main run.
*   [Shortened the reset time](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/d07a6ffee786001e7e046bb78fc192ee55ad76c1/sim/full_spice_sim.cir#L133) so it only takes about 100ns at the start of the test (and actual mode selection is stable by 120ns, if not sooner).
*   [Only store data for the things we care about](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/d07a6ffee786001e7e046bb78fc192ee55ad76c1/sim/full_spice_sim.cir#L136-L146) to avoid chewing up too much memory (or writing a multi-GB `.raw` file).
*   [Write those respective data values](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/d07a6ffee786001e7e046bb78fc192ee55ad76c1/sim/full_spice_sim.cir#L160-L170) to a raw file named `full_spice_sim.raw`.
*   [Only try to simulate up to 256 lines](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-vga-fun/blob/d07a6ffee786001e7e046bb78fc192ee55ad76c1/sim/full_spice_sim.cir#L147). It takes up to 8 hours per line (!) so I'll never get that far anyway, unless I can find another way to speed up/optimise the sim.

# NOTES

*   Current version of sim does about 4.3us per hour.
*   Would it make any difference if the DAC was biased so that it looks like it has a 0.9 Vref?
*   If you gracefully stop an ngspice simulation with Ctrl-C, it's possible to continue it with `resume`
*   Using the ngspice `stop` command sets a breakpoint (I think in parallel with a running simulation), and may allow for us to periodically stop at specific times, write out a .raw file, and then `resume`. Search the manual for `Stop: Set a breakpoint`.

# VGA digital block improvements

*   SPI interfacing mode
*   Fix extra mode settings, inc. gated/ungated, registered
*   Option to output 
*   Option to offset XOR pattern by some amount that makes hard transitions more obvious in the first line
*   Implement 'bars' mode
*   Mode for a specific binary pattern that is useful within the first (say) 64 pixels (2.56us).
*   Make first 10 (or 16?) pixels output a 0/255 (black/white) bit pattern to show the current (effective/offset) line number.
*   In XOR mode, some bits to specify a different start line, and maybe sample every HSYNC, e.g. for `ui_in`:
    *   (NOTE: 9th bit, e.g. actual display line MSB, could be used in some way to flip another bit that otherwise can't be accessed, e.g. bit 0?)
    *   During reset: t011sssr:
        *   t is VGA timing mode
        *   011 selects mode 3 (XOR)
        *   sss is start line number:
            *   0 = 0
            *   1 = 1
            *   2 = 2
            *   3 = 3
            *   4 = 8
            *   5 = 32
            *   6 = 128
            *   7 = 192
        *   r is: 0=unregistered; 1=registered
    *   During HSYNC (or at HSYNC's falling edge?):
        *   Either: x011xxxx: Continue
        *   Or: sSSSssss:
            *   sssss: Upper 5 bits of start line
            *   SSS: Lower 3 bits XORed with 011
            *   Examples:
                *   00110000: CONTINUE (above), but otherwise would be 0.
                *   00100000: Line 1
