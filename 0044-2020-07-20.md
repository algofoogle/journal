I want to take a break tonight from project work.

I got a good-enough `t08f` working, including fit, with the ball making different tones depending on whether it hits a wall or the paddle. This is in the [`t08f-opt3`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/tree/t08f-opt3/fpga/XC9572XL/test08/t08f) branch and I should merge it into `master` and tidy it up a bit.

NOTE: There is one more change at home which I haven't committed yet.

I also tried adding the blue channel, but it doesn't look like I can get this to fit. Not that concerned because the game DOES work as you'd expect.

So, what next?

*   Finish off `t08f` code commits and doco.
*   Maybe make a proper plug-in PCB for it? Including a FET to drive the speaker, better buttons, and 9V battery supply?
*   Consider doing a PAL video project: Ball game, or simpler? B/W or colour?
*   Study memory-like Verilog with async reads/writes.
*   Start working towards NES cart.
*   Try DRAM access.

[Datasheet](http://www.minuszerodegrees.net/memory/4116/datasheet_MB8116.pdf).
*   Use DRAM to make a simple video card. Timing should be OK if we can read a whole byte at a time, in advance, before displaying its respective pixels. This is perhaps where "colour planes" come in, too.
*   CPU driver (Z80 or 6502?)
