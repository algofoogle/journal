# Efabless shutdown

Efabless suddenly and unexpectedly went out of business, officially closing its doors at the end of February 2025.

A consequence of this, sky130 fabrication is on hold (maybe indefinitely).

This is a shame because (aside from loving working there), I might not ever get back the TT08 project I was about to receive and test, to say nothing of TT09 and other test chips I had undergoing fabrication.

Oh well, we'll see what happens. I might work on learning the IHP PDK for a while.


# Local hardening notes for TT10

These are notes I took at the time for doing local TT10 hardening, prior to Efabless shutdown.

Thus, they are for TT10, when that was still going to be a sky130 shuttle...

## Digital control block hardening attempts

Setup:

```bash
cd ~/projects/tt10-vga-TEST
git clone -b tt10 https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt-support-tools tt
mkdir ~/ttsetup@tt10
python3.11 -m venv ~/ttsetup@tt10/venv --prompt tt10
source ~/ttsetup@tt10/venv/bin/activate
pip install -r tt/requirements.txt
```

Then copy in `~/projects/tt09-ring-osc3/env-tt09.sh` and rename to `env-tt10.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ ! -d ./tt ]; then
    echo "ABORTING as ./tt/ does not exist yet."
    echo "See the tt-support-tools step of: https://tinytapeout.com/guides/local-hardening/"
    echo "Typically, you'd run: git clone -b tt10 https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt-support-tools tt"
    return 1
fi

if [[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" == "${0}" ]]; then
    echo "WARNING: It looks like you ran $0 directly."
    echo "NORMALLY you should instead run: source $0"
    echo "MAYBE you want to give that another try?"
fi

export TTPYTHON=python3.11
export TTPROMPT=tt10
export TTTOOLS=/home/anton/ttsetup@tt10
mkdir -p "$TTTOOLS/pdk"
export PDK_ROOT=$TTTOOLS/pdk
export PDK=sky130A
export OPENLANE2_TAG=2.2.9

export LINTER_LOG_BASE="runs/wokwi/*-verilator-lint/verilator-lint.log"

export VENV_DIR="$TTTOOLS/venv"
export VENV_CMD="$VENV_DIR/bin/activate"
if [ ! -e "$VENV_CMD" ]; then
    echo "NOTE: Venv $VENV_CMD doesn't exist; creating it..."
    $TTPYTHON -m venv --prompt "$TTPROMPT" "$VENV_DIR"
    echo "DONE."
fi
echo "Activating VENV..."
source "$VENV_CMD"
echo "NOTE: If prompt doesn't include '($TTPROMPT)' then make sure you run this script via 'source'"
```

Run `source ./env-tt10.sh`

Create `harden.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

if [ -z "$VIRTUAL_ENV" ]; then echo "VENV is not loaded. Did you remember to run: source ./env-tt10.sh"; exit 1; fi

echo "Regenerating user config..."
./tt/tt_tool.py --create-user-config --openlane2 && (
    echo "Running local hardening..."
    ./tt/tt_tool.py --harden --openlane2
)
```

Run `pip install openlane==$OPENLANE2_TAG`

Run `./tt/tt_tool.py --create-user-config --openlane2`


## Making a DEF for custom pin placement in OpenLane 2

I was working on this at the time both to learn how to do it, and to create an irregular digital block area that would use abutment for superimposed analog/digital pin connections...

*   Update Verilog to generate thermo-code outputs for SEGDACs, as well as vbias control pass-through.
*   Define the boundary (`DIEAREA`).
*   Place/copy the pins/ports to match TT IOs at the top.
*   Place *inset* pins in the bottom-left that will drive the SEGDACs directly (without separate thermo2bit decoders). Don't forget vbias digital inputs.
*   Save the DEF.
*   Measure the inset box and either write BLOCKAGES for it or (better, as it's exposed and won't be lost?) put in OL2:
    *   [`FP_OBSTRUCTIONS`](https://openlane2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/step_config_vars.html#var-openroad-floorplan-fp-obstructions)
    *   [`ROUTING_OBSTRUCTIONS`](https://openlane2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/step_config_vars.html#add-obstructions)
    *   [`PDN_OBSTRUCTIONS`](https://openlane2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/step_config_vars.html#add-pdn-obstructions)
*   Try OL2 harden with this DEF and make sure it correctly uses the inset pins.
