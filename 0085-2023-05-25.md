# Raybox

## Accomplishments

*   Fixed to work with fixed-point values other than Q12.12 (e.g. Q9.12, Q16.16, Q10.9).
*   Map is now 64x64 with 3 wall types (plus empty), sample map ROM provided, and the 2 extra wall textures.
*   `utils/asset_tool` updated to handle sprites, walls, and maps.
*   Minor other updates

## Notes

*   Current texture sizes:
    *   Individual sprites are 64x64 and 6bpp (RGB222):
        *   4096 pixels, 24576 bits, equiv. 3KiB.
    *   Each wall is twice this (due to light/dark modes). If the engine instead could output
        RGB333 (even if the textures are RGB222) then it could just do dark tints of
        textures instead of needing a 2nd texture. Anyway, 1 wall is:
        *   8192 pixels, 49152 bits, equiv. 6KiB.
    *   So, if we want 3 different types of walls, that's 18KiB.
*   Reducing texture sizes:
    *   Assume each wall texture is 64x64:
        *   4bpp (indexed) for a total of 16 colours.
        *   Each index looks up a palette entry that is (say) RGB333: 16x9 bits = 144 bits = 18 bytes equiv.
        *   Darker versions are either 2nd palettes or just shifted.
*   Wall textures should flip depending on whether they are on opposing wall sides.
