## Things to do

*   Get my website going again. Some of the things that become notes here could be articles at https://ammauro.com instead. I had done some work *somewhere* (maybe in a VM on my desktop computer, not yet committed??) on improving its presentation (modern HTML5/CSS, etc?) after [I upgraded it for newer Linux and Ruby platforms](https://github.com/algofoogle/anton.maurovic.com/commit/665db65476b093faa88d46f9e59b5996aeaec563).
*   DONE: ~~Make a shell script for creating new journal entries in this repo.~~
*   Fix mouse wheel in Ubuntu 20 Desktop VM, in VirtualBox, on Windows host.
*   Prep a [TinyTapeout](https://tinytapeout.com/) 03 (TT03) submission based on [solo_squash](https://github.com/algofoogle/solo_squash). Cutoff is 23 Apr 2023!

## Recent stuff

*   I've been studying [Zero to ASIC Course](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/).
    *   My base design: [solo_squash](https://github.com/algofoogle/solo_squash) - simple VGA game resembling 1-player Pong.
    *   Wrapped in Caravel: [solo-squash-caravel](https://github.com/algofoogle/solo-squash-caravel) - i.e. for Google Skywater Open MPW program.
    *   Registered with [Efabless](https://platform.efabless.com/dashboard). Waiting on Google-sponsored MPW9 to open. I want to do a much bigger/better design for this though. Ideally a real-time ray-caster (e.g. Wolf3D-style renderer).
*   Working on getting back into 2D ray-casting:
    *   Goal is to make a hardware-based Wolf3D-style renderer.
    *   I'm figuring out algorithms in C++ first: [raybox-app](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-app)
    *   Then I'll try the equivalent in Verilog: [raybox](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox)
