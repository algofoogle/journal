## Things to do

*   Get my website going again. Some of the things that become notes here could be articles at https://ammauro.com instead. I had done some work *somewhere* (maybe in a VM on my desktop computer, not yet committed??) on improving its presentation (modern HTML5/CSS, etc?) after [I upgraded it for newer Linux and Ruby platforms](https://github.com/algofoogle/anton.maurovic.com/commit/665db65476b093faa88d46f9e59b5996aeaec563).
*   **DONE:** [Make a shell script for creating new journal entries in this repo.](./Makefile) - Run `make new` or just `make`.
*   **DONE:** [Fix mouse wheel in Ubuntu 20 Desktop VM, in VirtualBox, on Windows host](#fixing-mouse-wheel-in-ubuntu-20-desktop-vm).
*   Prep a [TinyTapeout](https://tinytapeout.com/) 03 (TT03) submission based on [solo_squash](https://github.com/algofoogle/solo_squash). Cutoff is 23 Apr 2023!

## Recent stuff

*   I've been studying [Zero to ASIC Course](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/).
    *   My base design: [solo_squash](https://github.com/algofoogle/solo_squash) - simple VGA game resembling 1-player Pong.
    *   Wrapped in Caravel: [solo-squash-caravel](https://github.com/algofoogle/solo-squash-caravel) - i.e. for Google Skywater Open MPW program.
    *   Registered with [Efabless](https://platform.efabless.com/dashboard). Waiting on Google-sponsored MPW9 to open. I want to do a much bigger/better design for this though. Ideally a real-time ray-caster (e.g. Wolf3D-style renderer).
*   Working on getting back into 2D ray-casting:
    *   Goal is to make a hardware-based Wolf3D-style renderer.
    *   I'm figuring out algorithms in C++ first: [raybox-app](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-app)
    *   Then I'll try the equivalent in Verilog: [raybox](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox)

## FPGA Ray Caster notes

*   My aim is to make hardware (FPGA or ASIC) that can accelerate some or all of the rendering for a simple ray-casting (i.e. Wolf3D-style) game.
*   Intended specs:
    *   Directly drive a VGA display at 320x200, 320x240, or 640x480 resolution.
    *   Use at least 2 bits per RGB channel, but preferably full 24-bit colour. 1-bit per channel can sort of work (e.g. blue on H walls, cyan on V walls) but would probably look crappy enough to break the effectiveness of how this looks.
    *   Motion control and collision detection?
    *   Sprites?
    *   64x64 map, or map checking comes from other logic or external memory/device?
    *   Flat wall colours first, maybe textures later?
    *   If we can't do real-time tracing, we could do it during VBLANK, or just double-buffer it.
*   [raybox-app](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-app) has some early clunky C++ code that does basic 2D ray casting by DDA
    *   DDA is Digital Differential Analysis (or Digital Differential Analyzer).
    *   My original reference was: https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html
    *   My heavily-commented reworking of the DDA algorithm used for wall-map-distance ray casting is [here](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-app/blob/f68521b80cede9f9668b9425f3ff47397e6bebbe/src/raybox.cpp#L333-L403).

*   Ideas:
    *   When later implementing in Verilog, in order to avoid costly division circuits, is there a way we can simultaneously calculate both the *distance* and the respective *height* of the wall column to render, embedded within the DDA loop? I could imagine a way to start with a reference height or initial height, and then subtract a progressively-decreasing number with each step.
    *   An alternative is to have a lookup table that can convert different ranges of input values to known integer height outputs; such a table would have (at most) 240 entries, except where taller-than-screen values are required.
    *   Will it work OK, though, with [fixed-point maths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic)? Wikipedia DDA article touches on it.


## Fixing mouse wheel in Ubuntu 20 Desktop VM

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Desktop VM, in VirtualBox, on a Windows host.

It's a common problem in VirtualBox, with a Linux guest using a GNOME (?) desktop environment,
that mousewheel events get discarded while the pointer is moving. There are lots of proposed
solutions to this, but below is what worked for me.

This borrows info from [here](https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=79002&start=15#p416603)
and [here](https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=79002&start=30#p518447),
mostly, and with a little modification.

1.  Powered off the VM, and go into VM settings.
2.  General &rarr; Advanced: Disable Drag'n'Drop
3.  System &rarr; Pointing Device: PS/2 Mouse
4.  Power on, then `sudo apt install imwheel`
6.  Create `~/.imwheelrc`:
    ```
    "^.*$"
        None, Up, Button4, 2
        None, Down, Button5, 2
        Shift_L,   Up,   Shift_L|Button4, 2
        Shift_L,   Down, Shift_L|Button5, 2
        Control_L, Up,   Control_L|Button4
        Control_L, Down, Control_L|Button5
    ```
7.  Run `imwheel -b "4 5"` -- it should background itself.
    *   Verify that mousewheel works, now, while moving the pointer in VSCode and Firefox.
8.  To make this permanent, make an autostart desktop entry:
    1.  ```bash
        cd ~
        mkdir -p .config/autostart
        ```
    2.  Create `.config/autostart/imwheel.desktop`:
        ```ini
        # This fixes the mousewheel while the pointer is moving.
        # See: https://github.com/algofoogle/journal/blob/master/0061-2023-04-16.md#fixing-mouse-wheel-in-ubuntu-20-desktop-vm
        [Desktop Entry]
        Type=Application
        Name=imwheel
        # The given -b option restricts this to the wheel and avoids breaking the side buttons.
        Exec=imwheel -b "4 5"
        StartupNotify=false
        Terminal=false
        ```
    3.  Reboot.
9.  Run `ps -fA | fgrep imwheel` to prove that imwheel is running.
