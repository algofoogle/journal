# Some fixes to raybox-zero-caravel

I found after running a two-frame `make coco_test_gl` that things became 'unknown'.

After working on a bunch of corrections and reworking the POV SPI stuff, I think I put it down to some registers that were not initialised at reset, as well as *maybe* some ambiguous states in how the POV SPI (and also spi_registers) works??

I think I've got it working now.

So far I've tested in Verilator (`make csr`) and on the FPGA. I tested most of vec/regs on the FPGA, plus demo mode 'inc' behaviour, and it seemed fine. I tested fewer (but enough?) of the vec/regs and demo 'inc' behaviour in Verilator, and they too seemed fine.

I also think I've got the `coco_test_gl` tests giving consistent results.

These are the tests I'm running on `coco_test_gl`:

*   i_inc_px/y disabled (00): Should have consistent vec overlay -- would allow POV SPI to take over if desired
    *   If this FAILS (**it didn't**):
        *   Stop the sim
        *   Load VCD
        *   Start next test
        *   Work out: Is the problem due to vec (POV), reg, or both?
        *   Inspect POV state -- use X5.gtkw? Make X6?
*   i_inc_px/y enabled: Should show difference in vec overlay
    *   This should weed out reg SPI errors, because it disables POV.
    *   If there is STILL a failure, either POV-disable is not working, or regs are bad.
    *   **NOTE: It worked**
*   Repeat with registered outputs (tests above were first done without)

If it works out OK, tidy up `(reset)` state and contract lines in POV to make it more readable.

While waiting for tests:
*   Write tests that actually send a new POV via LA SPI. NOTE: SOC might be too slow to do this within 1 frame! Or sometimes it executes too fast (when cached).
*   Design use of IO[11] as clock: Put it in a smarter position (top-right?); get rid of user_clock2 -- Don't forget user_defines for it, too. No longer analog! Make sure OEB is set correctly (and not conflicting with Ellen)
*   Remove i_test_wb_clk_i and replace its gpout1:alt with something else
*   Try analog part:
    *   Harald Pretl custom cell?
    *   Custom GDS in TT05? -- Suffers no nice output. Look at Harald's TT05 submission
    *   Full custom GDS drop-in -- Power/LVS is confusing
    *   Analog GDS portion to add to UPW -- borrow from Pawel
*   Check latest hardens after code fixes (and reports)
*   Do final test run on FPGA

Note to Pawel to bring in new version:
*   top_ew_algofoogle.v (and GL netlist?)
*   tests
*   GDS/LEF, etc
*   updated snippet

# Next steps

*   **Set up extra tests to run overnight (inc. extra frames)**
