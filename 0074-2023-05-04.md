# Raybox notes

*   Sim: Now renders `gOvers` guide as well as fixed-point equivalent direct from design.

# Next

*   Rework the FSM to give it more stages/time for combo calculations to settle,
    then more time to write/cascade, but also more opportunity to test
    (i.e. inspect registers or use on-chip LA).
    *   NOTE: Extra FSM stages could allow us to reuse a single reciprocal, instead of needing 3.
        Having 3 gives minimal performance gains because (I think) it is only used
        at the beginning and end of each ray, not at each step.
*   Work out what to do with branches:
    *   Tag LKG (Last Known Good) FPGA version.
    *   Make a new branch for FPGA module tests.
    *   Consider what to back-merge into `main`.
    *   Ultimately try to go for a git-flow-style approach,
        so we can have known-good (`main`), in-progress (`develop`),
        experiments (features) and small improvements (hotfixes).
*   Try fixing viewplane stepper: It needs to work before we optimise everything else.
*   FPGA debugging of different modules, using OSD pixel display OR output signals, OR on-chip LA?
