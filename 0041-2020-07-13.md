How official is this?

Sometimes "Fit" will apparently fail with no explanation, despite everything seeming to have worked. I've tried running the command manually and seen that it gives a SEGFAULT. Evidently a solution to this is to go to the properties for the "Fit" process, select "Reports", and change "HDL Equations Style" to ABEL.

Paddle doesn't go all the way to the top because the comparison between `v` and `paddle` only happens while `v` is still one line behind. Changing it to be exact would probably add extra adder/subtractor logic that we can't afford.
