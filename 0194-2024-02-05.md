# Getting TT03p5 ready for demo

- [x] Merge PR from Pat
- [x] Reimplement the design on my FPGA:
    *   ALL outputs inc. LZC, i.e. full wrapped TT TOP in de0nano wrapper
    *   Detach RP2040 or use it for input control?
    *   What to do for VGA out? Just use 270R all the way on one of my DAC PCBs?
- [ ] Test VGA signal outputs with 270R, and current on scope
- [x] Test aux out and measure voltage: OK, 1.0V.
- [ ] Test speaker and measure current (scope or DMM?)
- [ ] Discussion of design
- [ ] Scope screenshots, etc.
- [x] Photo of the running system in de0nano README
- [ ] Advanced tests (LZC, etc)

It works as expected on the FPGA, inc. LZC signals and `speaker` done as line-out:



See [DE0-Nano pin mapping here](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt03p5-solo-squash/blob/409d02378738a7824ce6a5fc7910f4eaeac6434b/de0nano/tt_um_algofoogle_solo_squash_de0nano.v#L4-L67).

Steps:

*   I pulled the tt03p5-solo-squash repo on my main PC where I use Quartus.
*   Note that this repo hasn't been wrapped for de0nano before. The original repo (solo_squash) might've been, but tt03p5-solo-squash is a *copy* of the code (because at the time TT03p5 didn't support git submodules).
*   Compared solo_squash core code with tt03p5 core code. Only change is that we need to comment out timescale (in tt03p5 version) -- was necessary for newer versions of OpenLane/yosys? I'll make the change in tt03p5.
*   Copied solo_squash repo's de0nano implementation [into tt03p5](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt03p5-solo-squash/tree/main/de0nano), and updated it to make sure:
    *   It matches current passive RGB333 board.
    *   SPI ROM (which is still plugged in) is held in a disabled state.
    *   Pushbuttons have correct polarity and GPIO-1 mapping is known/correct.
*   Included an option to visualise the speaker on a lower bit of all colour channels.
*   Made sure the design runs as expected, inc. buttons.
*   Implemented speaker output on another pin, testing with voltage-divided 'line out' levels.
*   Checked col0 and row0 behaviour as well as LZC low bit -- working as expected.
*   NEXT: Take measurements: voltage and current, ideally via scope.

Notes:

*   DE0-Nano's GPIO-0 header is the one nearest the LEDs, while GPIO-1 is nearest the DIP switches.
*   GPIO-0 is the one for which I designed the Pi Pico bridge.
*   GPIO-1 is the one that I've typically plugged the VGA DAC and SPI ROM into.
*   vga_spi_rom's code [include a diagram](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt05-vga-spi-rom/blob/9208ed836d03bb5593d383a55a8ddcab464ed9d2/de0nano/de0nano_top.v#L43-L91) of GPIO-1 pin mapping.
*   NOTE: There's also the [older RGB111 version](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero/blob/3b521292e77603b433e0d2859a50c0b14d5f2d26/de0nano/raybox-zero_de0nano.v#L56-L87) of my VGA DAC board.
*   Note that I usually make one of the onboard pushbuttons into the reset line.
