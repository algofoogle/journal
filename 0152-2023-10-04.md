# SPI flash ROM next steps

*   Implement test bench:
    *   Want to get a VCD to check SPI timing.
    *   Use iverilog, verilator, or cocotb?
    *   Try running cocotb on Windows? It needs iverilog too.
*   When was the last time I wrote a TB and cocotb tests? Was it solo_squash? Examples:
    *   [solo_squash:test/test_solo_squash.py](https://github.com/algofoogle/solo_squash/blob/main/test/test_solo_squash.py)
    *   [tt03p5-solo-squash:src/test.py](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt03p5-solo-squash/blob/main/src/test.py)
    *   [wrapped_rgb_mixer:caravel_rgb_mixer/test_rgb_mixer.py](https://github.com/mattvenn/wrapped_rgb_mixer/blob/mpw5/caravel_rgb_mixer/test_rgb_mixer.py)
*   In Z2A, cocotb is introduced in part 2.1, and used again in 5.1


# Set up Python on Windows, to be used by cocotb

I've done this, and created [Tip 2310A](./tips/2310A.md) to describe the process.


# Creating the tests

1.  I'll use cocotb for now.
2.  In the project dir, create `test/`
3.  In there, create the testbench, `tb.v`. Main points:
    *   Define inputs and outputs that we want the tests to have control over, giving them meaningful names.
    *   Have an `initial` block that specifies the `$dumpfile` (in this case `tb.vcd`).
    *   Instantiate and wire up the design, calling it `uut`. In this case, it's the `vga_spi_rom` module.
4.  Create a .venv for cocotb and these tests.
5.  Create `test.py` and fill it in -- more to come.
6.  Create `Makefile` that uses cocotb -- more to come.
7.  Write README describing how to set up everything and run the tests.


# Set up iverilog on Windows

*   **TBC!**
*   Need to [set up iverilog on Windows](https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/usage/installation.html#compiling-for-windows) too by probably doing a MinGW build, but see also [this](https://iverilog.fandom.com/wiki/Installation_Guide#Compiling_on_MS_Windows_(MinGW)) which links to more detail about MSYS2.



# Notes

*   [Simulated `spiflash` inside a Caravel testbench](https://github.com/mattvenn/wrapped_rgb_mixer/blob/8134e091d816ef390c96f353831311ba90ed6b76/caravel_rgb_mixer/rgb_mixer_tb.v#L90-L99)
*   In Verilog, given an `assign` is like a direct wire/net connection, does it matter whether something is on LHS or RHS, if using simple direct signals rather than expressions?
