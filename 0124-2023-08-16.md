# More raybox-zero

## Notes

*   Started transferring stuff from the Raybox tracer into `wall_tracer` and recalling how
    it worked, writing some improved notes, and looking for places to optimise.
*   Need to try and understand my own `rayAddend` (`rayAddendX` and `rayAddendY`) better,
    from the original Raybox, and in particular the use of `>>>8` (&div;256) versus 
    any other value, and how it compares with the half-height multiplier (e.g. &times;240).

## Next steps

*   Get more of the original Raybox tracer transferred over.
*   Implement map -- internal ROM initially; external memory access option later?
*   Make sure tracer works with our slightly different frame/row-based inputs/outputs.
