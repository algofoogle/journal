# More raybox-zero

## Notes

*   Need to try and understand my own `rayAddend` (`rayAddendX` and `rayAddendY`) better,
    from the original Raybox, and in particular the use of `>>>8` (&div;256) versus 
    any other value, and how it compares with the half-height multiplier (e.g. &times;240).

## Next steps

*   Implement map -- internal ROM initially; external memory access option later?
