# Raybox ideas

*   We're going to need a hardware multiplier, I think, but can we get away without a hardware divider?
*   How is raycasting done on very limited CPUs, e.g. 6502?
*   Precompute viewplane step size (inc. fixed-multiply by view vector) to avoid cameraX/w division.
*   Angular resolution: What's the minimum number of angles (or minimum rotation size) we need to support in order to get smooth movement?
*   Can we avoid rotation (and go with FULLY precomputed values) for camera in 1st iteration, and just prove strafing motion first, and rotation later?
