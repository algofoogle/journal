*   Read [cocotb Quickstart guide](https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/quickstart.html).
*   Started working on faster LZC per [this](https://digitalsystemdesign.in/leading-zero-counter/)
    (based on [this research paper](http://iris.elf.stuba.sk/JEEEC/data/pdf/6_115-05.pdf)).
*   [This patent looks interesting](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6330000B1/en)
    but given it's a patent, I'm interested more for academic purposes.
*   [Google Colab for OpenLane synth](https://colab.research.google.com/github/chipsalliance/silicon-notebooks/blob/main/digital-inverter-openlane.ipynb#scrollTo=rbT-vP0h0enK).
*   Learn more about [Horner's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method).
*   If we do want to store our trace distances (or heights) as something like floating-point,
    consider [this](https://digitalsystemdesign.in/fixed-point-to-floating-point-conversion/).
*   Can optionally disable KLayout steps to improve OpenLane synth speed a bit:
    ```json
    "RUN_KLAYOUT_XOR": 0,
    "RUN_KLAYOUT_DRC": 0,
    ```
*   I should try newer versions of OpenLane.
*   How to get/use the HS cells?
*   `python3 run_designs.py raybox_reciprocal --regression designs/raybox_reciprocal/config.txt --threads 4`
