# Accomplishments

*   PicoDeo: Started implementing raybox-bridge First Person Shooter game logic for controlling
    the player's movement and representing it on-screen in Windows (primitive top-down view).
    This will become the source of vector data to be sent to Raybox via PicoDeo/SPI. In the procss
    I learned a little more about Pygame rendering.
*   Got rough vectors tracking going in the Python part. Need to add mouse rotation support.


# Next steps

*   Get mouse rotation working. This will require keeping track of mouse rotations progressively
    instead of via the "tick" handler.
*   Load map and render map overlay?
*   Consider making the Raybox sim (with Verilator) actually match the input, output, and rendering
    that will happen on the FPGA, i.e. even though it runs very slowly, have a separate thread that
    tries to do real-time player position/view updating and sends it to the FPGA over PicoDeo, but
    also try to burst-update that data via Verilator SPI whenever a new frame starts rendering.

# Notes

*   My `raybox-bridge.py` source requires at least Python 3.10 because it uses `match`.
    For some reason when trying to run Python debugging in VSCode on Windows 10 (my home desktop PC)
    it tries to use Python 3.9.13 (`C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\python3.9.exe`)
    instead of the .venv (and system) Python 3.11.4. This might be because in VSCode I've started a
    workspace comprising raybox, sandpit, and journal... and it doesn't seem to respect .venv
    in this case? I'm working around this by going to the VSCode Command Palette
    (<kbd>CTRL+SHIFT+P</kbd>) then `Python: Select interpreter` => `Select at workspace level` =>
    then picking 3.11.4. This seems to do the trick: F5 (debug-run) now works OK.
