I need to finish [02-control] from yesterday.

I also need to write a Linux program for communicating with it. A simple version would do the following:

1.  Take a directive via command-line, e.g. to get pin status, or change it.
2.  Open a connection to the device (i.e. `open("/dev/ttyACM0", ...)`).
3.  Write a check byte (e.g. `A`).
4.  Read a byte back to make sure it's working (which will be the status of pins).
5.  Write the actual requested command-line command.
6.  Read back the status, and output it to `STDOUT` in a meaningful format.

Note that steps 4 and 6 will need a timeout.
