# Notes:

*   Typedef (custom types) [can be done in SystemVerilog](https://fpgatutorial.com/systemverilog-typedef-enum-struct/) but not Verilog.
*   I think I read that the product operator (i.e. `*` for multiplication) can synthesise directly in Verilog, but not division.
*   I'm going for [Q6.10 fixed point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(number_format)) by default.
*   In some cases it might be appropriate to use different decimal placements, and scale afterwards.
*   There is no `assert` in Verilog or SV?? At least not for iverilog?
*   Is there a way to do what we want with better precision using Rationals (i.e. numerators and denominators) instead of Fixed Point?
*   Can negative Verilog vector bit indices make it easier to increase/decrease precision?
    i.e. instead of `reg [7:0] prec8 = prec16[11:4]`, is there a benefit in doing `reg [3:-4] prec8 = prec16[3:-4]` be better?
*   In Verilog, `>>` is bit shift, while `>>>` is arithmetic shift (which preserves sign).
*   We don't have to stick with the same Qm.n (i.e. integer/fractional alignment) for all of our fixed-point stuff. Where suitable, we can favour more M or more N, so long as we're careful when we mix them.
