Need to learn how to do C++ debugging in VSCode on Linux. For more info, see:

# Fixed-point raybox-app

I've started working on a [`fixed-point` branch](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-app/tree/fixed-point) in my `raybox-app` repo, with the aim being to use just fixed-point maths for the tracer, and do it in a way that closely matches how my Verilog code works in [`raybox`](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox). An extra inclusion is the ability to easily adjust the Qm.n parameters (i.e. integer vs. fractional bit depths) to see if it helps with overall precision and quality.

Hopefully using Q6.10 (as the `raybox` Verilog currently does) should reveal similar problems. If so, I can then work out whether it's got merely a precision problem, or a maths problem, or some other logic error.
