# Quick first attempt at TTIHP0p2

TT Discord channel [`#ttihp0p2-tapeout`](https://discord.com/channels/1009193568256135208/1290548711075741796) discusses an experimental IHP PDK tapeout open for contributions, following the closed [tinytapeout-ihp-0p1](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tinytapeout-ihp-0p1) tapeout. I was lucky to have [TT07's raybox-zero selected](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tinytapeout-ihp-0p1/tree/main/projects/tt_um_algofoogle_raybox_zero) for that earlier one.

I used [ttihp-verilog-template](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/ttihp-verilog-template) to try creating a couple of projects...


## solo-squash for TTIHP0p2

I replicated my simple solo-squash Pong-like VGA game as submitted to TT03p5: https://github.com/algofoogle/ttihp-solo-squash -- it [seems to harden fine](https://github.com/algofoogle/ttihp-solo-squash/actions/runs/11308698839) via the GHAs.

**I need to [implement tests](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/ttihp-verilog-template/tree/main/test) and have a mode option to select between "classic", TinyVGA Pmod, and potentially other output modes.**

NOTE: This flow uses ORFS instead of OpenLane. Might also be incomplete from a TT standpoint (e.g. no GL sim yet, at least not in GHA?). Here's what I did to set it up:

*   Fork https://github.com/TinyTapeout/ttihp-verilog-template => https://github.com/algofoogle/ttihp-solo-squash
*   Settings => Pages => Source: GitHub Actions
*   Actions => Enable
*   Clone to my VM in `~/projects/ttihp-solo-squash`
*   NOTE: Last time I submitted to TT it was TT03p5 (and it included the [lzc test](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt03p5-solo-squash/blob/7521bb47e1730e20988039a5294c66ee08340811/src/top.v#L54)) but since then I've also submitted to GF180. Need to compare code versions: [tt03p5](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt03p5-solo-squash/tree/main/src) & [GF180](https://github.com/algofoogle/algofoogle-multi-caravel/tree/gf180/verilog/rtl/solo_squash/src) are static copies, but there's also solo-squash-caravel-v2 which [has it as a submodule](https://github.com/algofoogle/solo-squash-caravel-v2/tree/main-gfmpw1/verilog/rtl).
*   For now, I'll add the (currently) latest commit of [solo_squash](https://github.com/algofoogle/solo_squash) as a submodule...
    ```bash
    cd src
    git submodule add https://github.com/algofoogle/solo_squash
    ```
*   I'll also add a copy of [lzc_fast.v](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt03p5-solo-squash/blob/main/src/lzc_fast.v) and then use [top.v](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt03p5-solo-squash/blob/main/src/top.v) as taken from tt03p5.
*   I merged `top.v` into `project.v`. NOTE: Original top.v uses `` `timescale `` but project.v does not.
*   **DON'T FORGET:** Need to make the VGA pinout (and possibly audio) match TT standards (e.g. TinyVGA).
*   Update `info.yaml`, *mostly* transposed from tt03p5 version.
*   Update README a little.
*   Update `docs/info.md`
*   In `project.v`, make sure unused inputs are referenced to suppress warnings.

### Notes

[`test`](https://github.com/algofoogle/ttihp-solo-squash/actions/runs/11308698840) action failed but [`gds`](https://github.com/algofoogle/ttihp-solo-squash/actions/runs/11308698839) and [`docs`](https://github.com/algofoogle/ttihp-solo-squash/actions/runs/11308698838) passed.

Utilisation of 1x1 tile is ~32%.

This is in the `gds` action:
```
Extracting clock period from SDC file: /home/runner/work/ttihp-solo-squash/ttihp-solo-squash/runs/wokwi/results/ihp-sg13g2/tt-submission/base/clock_period.txt
Setting clock period to 20000
```

Is that 20ns? Where does it come from?

This warning is also shown in the GDS summary page, but I assume we can ignore this:
```
Warning: Found unsupported expression 'SCE*SCD+SCE'*D' in pin attribute of cell 'sg13g2_sdfbbp_1' - skipping.
```


## raybox-zero for TTIHP0p2

I tried to [put the TT07 version of raybox-zero into the template](https://github.com/algofoogle/ttihp0p2-algofoogle/tree/rbz) (note: `rbz` branch of that repo). I can get it to harden, but it fails DRC -- evidently a [bug](https://discord.com/channels/1009193568256135208/1295436096305369088/1295466872363421776) (maybe in ORFS) to do with Metal2 area being too small in some cases.

I should file a bug with a reproducible, but not sure how to do that yet.

I was hardening at 6x2. I managed to get the flow to run locally and I got it to just barely harden successfully in 4x2 tiles with a `PLACE_DENSITY` of 0.78.

Getting the flow to run locally took a little fiddling, and one thing I recall was doing `sudo apt install python3-tk`. Here's the `ttihp-env.sh` file I ended up creating in the repo dir:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

export FLOW=orfs
