# Belated update for TTIHP0p2 and TT09 submissions

This update was actually done in early Dec 2024, because I hadn't gotten around to doing a proper update in 2 months.

I [submitted raybox-zero](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/ttihp0p2/tt_um_algofoogle_raybox_zero) for [TTIHP0p2](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/ttihp0p2/). It was 4x2 tiles. Not sure what allowed it to fit in what turned out to be an early attempt only; I was also trying to optimize it and after a bunch of 'optimizations' the same configuration would no longer fit in 4x2 (maybe not even in 6x2). That's my memory of it anyway. See [below](#failed-tt09-raybox-zero-mini) for more info.

From what I recall, while the TTIHP0p2 GHA is designed for Ubuntu 24.04, with help from [htfab](https://github.com/htfab), I was able to install it and run ORFS (etc) on my Ubuntu 22.04 VM. The gist was just to compile everything from a newer version of OpenROAD, I think.

Anyway, on that same shuttle, htfab adapted my TT08 analog VGA submission and made it work with [RGB444](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/ttihp0p2/tt_um_algofoogle_vga_fun_wrapper) and [RGB222](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/ttihp0p2/tt_um_algofoogle_tinyvga_fun_wrapper) dithering.



# Failed tt09-raybox-zero-mini

I was trying to make a basic version of [raybox-zero](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero) fit in 2x2 tiles on TT09. I wasn't quite able to get there (it was still trying to complete detailed routing after [6 hours](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt09-raybox-zero-mini/actions/runs/11666514916)).

The options I was working on, I think, were to disable external textures and support reduced fixed-point precision to fit in 2x2 tiles on TT09, but I couldn't quite make it. The failed attempts at that are found in [tt09-raybox-zero-mini](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt09-raybox-zero-mini).

At the time, I adapted the code to support a number of conditional compilation options (i.e. `rbz_options.v`) to disable parts of it or otherwise adjust its fixed-point precision, and I think I was trying to include a better pinout (supporting different QSPI PMOD options).

I think it would be interesting to try making this work by doing the reciprocal using the Newton-Raphson method.

Anyway, explored optimization options were:
*   No ext. textures
*   Lower precision
*   Fewer SPI registers (less functionality)
*   Combined SPI regs for POV & REG (smaller buffers)
*   No trace or map overlay debug


# TT09 Ring Oscillator experiments

I tried submitting 3 different ring oscillator experiments to TT09, to see if OpenLane would harden them, and if they'd be able to work.

Looks like Uri tried the same sort of thing: https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt09/tt_um_urish_giant_ringosc

Mine are:
*   https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt09/tt_um_algofoogle_tt09_ring_osc:
    *   The simplest one; 1001-inverter ring.
    *   Apply power, and hopefully `uo_out[0]` will produce a square oscillation somewhere in the range of 7MHz to 36MHz.
*   https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt09/tt_um_algofoogle_tt09_ring_osc2:
    *   4 independent rings, from inverter rings of each depth: 125, 251, 501, 1001 -- on `uo_out[0:3]`
    *   NOTE: If these are too fast or unstable, core voltage could probably be reduced?
    *   ring_501 clocks a counter, and `uo_out[4]` is (I think) its div-16 output (1.75MHz).
    *   ring_125 clocks a counter, and `uo_out[5]` is (I think) its div-16 output too (7MHz).
    *   Also includes a 25-inverter ring connected to a 6-bit counter. 6th bit output (div-64) is `uo_out[6]` -- 8.9MHz? `uio_out[6]` is also the high-frequency (70MHz? 140MHz??) PWM result of comparing the counter's low 2 bits with `ui_in[1:0]`
    *   Also includes a 13-inverter ring connected to a 5-bit counter. `uo_out[7]` is the 5th bit (div-32): ~34MHz? `uio_out[7]` is the (140MHz? 280MHz??) PWM output of the low 2 bits compared with `ui_in[3:2]` while `uio_out[1]` is PWM at half that frequency, comparing the low 3 bits with `ui_in[7:5]`.
    *   The aim with the PWM stuff here is to see whether the TT digital mux can produce something resembling an analog level by doing PWM fast enough (well above its rated max speed).
*   https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt09/tt_um_algofoogle_tt09_ring_osc3:
    *   1 ring, but feedback is tapped at one of 8 points, selected by `ui_in[2:0]`:
        *   0: 11 inverters
        *   1: 21 inverters
        *   2: 31 inverters
        *   3: 41
        *   4: 51
        *   5: 101
        *   6: 301
        *   7: 1001
    *   `uo_out[0]` is the ring output frequency.
    *   `uo_out[7:1]` is the output of a 7-bit counter clocked by the ring output frequency.
    *   Thus, if the input is 7, we've got a 1001-inverter ring in effect (plus marignal tap-mux delay), so probably about 14MHz... in which case `uo_out[1]` should be about 7MHz, all the way up to `uo_out[7]` at ~110kHz.

I wanted to simulate these, but I had trouble with extraction; Magic bug? Some discussion of the issue [here](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/magic/issues/353) and [here](https://discord.com/channels/1009193568256135208/1304966276929814668/1304992269140623373).
