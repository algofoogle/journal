GT's [QSPIFLASHSIM](https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sim/verilator/qspiflashsim.cpp) uses an approach where it [assumes a hard-coded clock (10nS period, so 100MHz)](https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/0d7b428abe5c9a02d86a0272e290baafae00f13f/sim/verilator/qspiflashsim.cpp#L59) and derives its other critical timing from that.
*   It assumes that each tick (i.e. each call to [`operator()`](https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/0d7b428abe5c9a02d86a0272e290baafae00f13f/sim/verilator/qspiflashsim.cpp#L118)) will advance the clock by some known amount automatically.
*   An example is where it [defines `tPP` to be 12 microseconds](https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/0d7b428abe5c9a02d86a0272e290baafae00f13f/sim/verilator/qspiflashsim.cpp#L67) (i.e. 12&times;100 "ticks" of 10nS each, hence 12,000nS or 12&micro;S), then [uses it to start a programming cycle](https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/0d7b428abe5c9a02d86a0272e290baafae00f13f/sim/verilator/qspiflashsim.cpp#L139), and finally [counts it down within each tick](https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/0d7b428abe5c9a02d86a0272e290baafae00f13f/sim/verilator/qspiflashsim.cpp#L123).

Alternatives would be to:
1.  Either: Use the approach above but instead of hard-coding the module to use 10nS increments, base all times on discrete nanoseconds and allow (re)definition of timing by the caller. Then time deltas could be based on the *defined* length of a single tick (rather than just 1 'unit'). It just means there might be cases where a timer ends up going *below* 0 rather than hitting exactly 0.
2.  OR: Let the caller tell us what the current time is (in nS), and we'll just hard-code all our known times in nanoseconds. That way, the caller can call us just when it wants to.

Another thing about the GT 'SIM' modules is that their `operator()` returns its result. This is pretty flexible because the result can be captured in a variable by the caller, then torn apart by the caller as it sees fit, and potentially fed into other module-under-test inputs. Alternatively, the `operator()` could be a `tick()` function that *assigns* its outputs via function call arguments (i.e. by-ref?). Maybe that's a bad idea, though, in case it doesn't properly get treated as an "assignment" handler, and also prevents us from easily manipulating the "wiring".

`t02a` now uses a skeleton `SimROM` class to simulate the ROM hardware. I will extend that soon to simulate timing.
