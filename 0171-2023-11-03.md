# Getting down to the final steps for chipIgnite

# Anton's checks of Pawel's repo and hardening

I've gone thru [caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode@raybox_and_mixed](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/tree/raybox_and_mixed) as best I can.

I think my UPW snippet, user_defines, GDS/LEF/DEF, netlist, etc. are all correct in Pawel's repo, for the current version of my design.

I only have the following observations:

1.  ~~I've done a [PR to change user_defines for reserved SoC pads](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/pull/1). Waiting on approval from Ellen and Pawel.~~
    *   **OK:** Pawel merged it.
2.  Ellen should just check, re user_defines: Do you actually intend to [make your PWM pins bidirectional and *also under MGMT control instead of USER design* by default](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/blob/d1d74e1ac4fedd3f56e86329bf6809208481407f/verilog/rtl/user_defines.v#L80-L82)? This is probably fine (and easily changed by firmware as required), but thought I'd check.
    *   **OK; TBA: Ellen will check this later, but it's not critical;** firmware can easily change it if necessary, at boot.
3.  `analog_io[4]` is not connected, neither is its corresponding digital[11]. Likewise, there is no `io_oeb[11]`. Is this intentional? [It was flagged as `bandgap` by Ellen originally](./0165-2023-10-24.md#ew-pin-allocation).
    *   **OK; TBA:** Ellen confirmed that this is no longer needed and so is a free pin. Anton will try using this as his clock pin instead of the internal `user_clock2`. Anton might still route `user_clock2` out as a gpout, to do experiments with it.
4.  Ellen's `top_mixed` has a port for `wb_sel_i`, but from what I can tell there are no pins for this in the GDS. I'm guessing this is not actually used by Ellen's design? I discovered this because I looked in `runs/*/logs/floorplan/3-initial_fp.log` and saw this warning:
    ```
    [WARNING STA-0201] /home/.../caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/openlane/user_project_wrapper/runs/23_11_02_11_42/results/synthesis/user_project_wrapper.v line 268, instance top_mixed port wbs_sel_i not found.
    ```
    This shows up also in `runs/*/logs/signoff/29-user_project_wrapper.lef.lvs.log`:
    ```
    Cell user_project_wrapper (0) disconnected node: wbs_sel_i[0]
    Cell user_project_wrapper (0) disconnected node: wbs_sel_i[1]
    Cell user_project_wrapper (0) disconnected node: wbs_sel_i[2]
    Cell user_project_wrapper (0) disconnected node: wbs_sel_i[3]
    ```
    *   **OK:** `wb_sel_i` is present in the code, but may not be required by Ellen anymore.
5.  ~~Looking at the final UPW (user_project_wrapper) GDS, there doesn't seem to really be anything in the analog region of Ellen's design, but maybe that's more private and going to be dropped in later?~~
    *   **OK:** To be expected, at the time of writing. WIP from Ellen.
6.  ~~config.json: I have no idea if this matters, but the main [user_project_wrapper config.json sets CLOCK_NET](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/blob/d1d74e1ac4fedd3f56e86329bf6809208481407f/openlane/user_project_wrapper/config.json#L10C19-L10C32) to `top_mixed.clk`, but that's not the name of the net...? I think it's `top_mixed.wb_clock_i`?~~
    *   **OK:** Pawel has [updated this](https://github.com/embelon/Silicon_Contact_3GBT/blob/dfcceb1e70b3a6f2a5fa34e9ac2d43633edb713a/openlane/user_project_wrapper/config.json#L9-L13). I didn't know you could specify multiple clock nets this way :smile:
7.  ~~config.json: [top_mixed PDN uses `vccd1 vssd1`](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/blob/d1d74e1ac4fedd3f56e86329bf6809208481407f/openlane/user_project_wrapper/config.json#L13) where [Pawel's opamp uses `VCC VSS`](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/blob/d1d74e1ac4fedd3f56e86329bf6809208481407f/openlane/user_project_wrapper/config.json#L15) - Is that correct?~~
    *   **OK:** Pawel confirmed this is OK.
8.  config.json: [VERILOG_FILES_BLACKBOX is using some files from `gl/` and others from `rtl/`](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/blob/d1d74e1ac4fedd3f56e86329bf6809208481407f/openlane/user_project_wrapper/config.json#L19-L24) - I assume this is OK? The copy of my `gl/top_ew_algofoogle.v` port list in Pawel's repo looks correct anyway.
    *   **OK; TBA:** This might get updated later when all GL netlists are available.
9.  config.json: Ellen's design is [not featured in EXTRA_LIBS and EXTRA_SPEFS](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/blob/d1d74e1ac4fedd3f56e86329bf6809208481407f/openlane/user_project_wrapper/config.json#L37-L45) - Is that OK?
    *   **OK; TBA:** Coming later when analog part is all finished.
10. UPW's [metrics.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/raybox_and_mixed/signoff/user_project_wrapper/metrics.csv) reports antenna violations:
    ```
    pin_antenna_violations  73
    net_antenna_violations  72
    ```
    I think these are all listed in `runs/*/logs/signoff/31-arc.log` and `runs/*/reports/signoff/31-antenna_violators.rpt`
    *   **TODO: Check latest results using new repo.**
5.  ~~Tests in [verilog/dv/rbz_basic](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/tree/raybox_and_mixed/verilog/dv/rbz_basic) are old versions (i.e. without shared inputs), but I don't suppose this matters. If the latest versions are needed, they are [here](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero-caravel/tree/ew/verilog/dv/rbz_basic)~~
    *   **OK:** Pawel has updated them.





# Anton's rough notes of the things he checked (more just for his own record)

*   I tried so many different hardens with the MPW9 CUP, but couldn't eliminate hold violations. All seemed to be stemming from LA pins. Not sure if this will end up being an issue but I had to abandon the [`ew-mpw9` branch](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero-caravel/tree/ew-mpw9) for now. I reverted back to using the MPW8 methods.
*   [Firmware samples for Matt to test PLL behaviour](https://discord.com/channels/778248761054986292/863022759428751360/1169751449534738433):
    >   Here's one that I think will do the trick: https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero-caravel/blob/ew/verilog/dv/blink_pll/blink_pll.c
    >   
    >   From reset, this should blink the GPIO 4 times quickly, then 4 times slowly, then change the PLL, and hopefully then just keep blinking forever slowly. I don't know what delay value to put in for `w = ...` on lines 19, 26, and 40 (depends on your input clock speed I guess) but for 25MHz these are probably good for seeing the result visually :slight_smile:
    >   
    >   If you wouldn't mind trying to run that, and reset a few times to make sure it is consistent, that will be very helpful! 
    >   
    >   Then there is one more variation, and that is to replace lines 34..37 with this, and again try a few resets to see if it gives consistent results:
    >   ```c
    >   reg_hkspi_pll_ena = 1;
    >   reg_hkspi_pll_source = 0b00001111;
    >   reg_hkspi_pll_bypass = 0;
    >   ```
    >   
    >   From simulation, that latter example is more likely to lock up the PLL, because it seems to glitch the core clock.
    **Matt has confirmed:** On his chip, both variants blink the GPIO as expected, and they do NOT lock up the SoC and show consistent behaviour after a few resets.
*   Checked out [my fork](https://github.com/algofoogle/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/tree/raybox_and_mixed) of [caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode@raybox_and_mixed](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/tree/raybox_and_mixed), switched to `raybox_and_mixed` branch, and checked the following:
    *   Essential files:
        ```
        $ md5sum gds/top_ew_algofoogle.gds lef/top_ew_algofoogle.lef def/top_ew_algofoogle.def verilog/gl/top_ew_algofoogle.nl.v verilog/gl/top_ew_algofoogle.v

        9d402165073e8a563e661ae8bb205be3  verilog/gl/top_ew_algofoogle.v
        ```
        These match all the latest files in my own repo.
    *   SNIPPET2_ShareIns.v snippet [in user_project_wrapper](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/blob/d1d74e1ac4fedd3f56e86329bf6809208481407f/verilog/rtl/user_project_wrapper.v#L165-L255) seems to match [my latest version](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero/blob/11f14a8eea395e571ca5be0ddf9380b064d072ec/src/rtl/ew_caravel_snippets/SNIPPET2_ShareIns.v)
    *   [user_defines.v](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/blob/raybox_and_mixed/verilog/rtl/user_defines.v):
        *   Generally seems correct, other than my PR to change the SoC pins' defaults.
        *   **Just get Ellen to check** that [putting the PWM pins under MGMT control by default](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/blob/d1d74e1ac4fedd3f56e86329bf6809208481407f/verilog/rtl/user_defines.v#L80-L82) is intended.
    *   [includes.rtl.caravel_user_project](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/blob/raybox_and_mixed/verilog/includes/includes.rtl.caravel_user_project) does not include Anton's and Ellen's designs, but I think this is correct: This file is just to harden Pawel's own macro.
    *   user_project_wrapper.v:
        *   Check:
            *   Pin assignments: No gaps or overlaps?
            *   OEBs and I-vs-O directions seem sensible?
        *   Findings:
            *   Generally all appears fine to me, except...
            *   **analog_io[4] is not connected, and neither is its corresponding digital pin (io[11]).**
    *   Compare top_ew_algofoogle.v:
        *   Pawel's blackboxed version matches my own source version.
    *   I'm not sure what's meant to be in `uprj_netlists.v` -- I haven't used it before, and a year ago there was talk of it having become irrelevant (i.e. because the `includes` now replace it?)
    *   Tests in [verilog/dv/rbz_basic](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/tree/raybox_and_mixed/verilog/dv/rbz_basic) are old versions (i.e. without shared inputs), but I don't suppose this matters. If the latest versions are needed, they are [here](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero-caravel/tree/ew/verilog/dv/rbz_basic)
    *   Check [config.json for UPW](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/blob/raybox_and_mixed/openlane/user_project_wrapper/config.json)
    *   I have no idea if this matters, but the main [user_project_wrapper config.json sets CLOCK_NET to top_mixed.clk](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/blob/d1d74e1ac4fedd3f56e86329bf6809208481407f/openlane/user_project_wrapper/config.json#L10C19-L10C32), but that's not the name of the net...? I think it's `top_mixed.wb_clock_i`?
        *   [top_mixed PDN uses `vccd1 and vssd1`](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/blob/d1d74e1ac4fedd3f56e86329bf6809208481407f/openlane/user_project_wrapper/config.json#L13) where [Pawel's opamp uses VCC and VSS](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/blob/d1d74e1ac4fedd3f56e86329bf6809208481407f/openlane/user_project_wrapper/config.json#L15) - Is that correct?
        *   [VERILOG_FILES_BLACKBOX is using some files from `gl/` and others from `rtl/`](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/blob/d1d74e1ac4fedd3f56e86329bf6809208481407f/openlane/user_project_wrapper/config.json#L19-L24) - I assume this is OK? My `gl/top_ew_algofoogle.v` port list looks correct in the repo anyway.
        *   Ellen's design is [not featured in EXTRA_LIBS and EXTRA_SPEFS](https://github.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/blob/d1d74e1ac4fedd3f56e86329bf6809208481407f/openlane/user_project_wrapper/config.json#L37-L45) - Is that OK?
    *   Review harden reports (fanout/cap/slew, antennas and pre-check)
*   [metrics.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/embelon/caravel-sky130-opamp-cascode/raybox_and_mixed/signoff/user_project_wrapper/metrics.csv) reports antenna violations:
    ```
    pin_antenna_violations  73
    net_antenna_violations  72
    ```

# In progress

*   [`ew-wbclk` branch](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero-caravel/tree/ew-wbclk) as has an option to feed `wb_clk_i` back out via gpout[1]:alt.
    *   [Harden was successful](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero-caravel/commit/f990f46bb19d5949e0304e0323ee7c8e5b52897b), of top_ew_algofoogle and UPW using this. Good to know: This has less-aggressive antenna violations (all under 2x). It also seems to have slightly better fanout figures (31 violations, worst is 17, average is -3).
    *   Seeking approval from Ellen/John to use it.
    *   In the spirit of "what could go wrong?" -- (a) The extra load from my mux could skew it? (b) The capacitance of the extra wire could also skew it, or at least throw off STA? (c) Could my design cause any noise on it?
    *   If we use it, provide an easy checklist for Pawel to patch it in.
*   Try updating raybox-zero-caravel to MPW9's commit number, then try harden again. Expect some merge conflicts...
    *   First part: starting `ew-mpw9` branch; updating from efabless to match MPW9 VM's CUP commit; fixing merge conflicts; starting harden (prior to committing the updates, given all the deleted old GDS/LEF/etc files)...

            ...is it telling me it can do better than 40ns? i.e. 29.12?

    *   2nd part: Put top_ew_algofoogle artefacts into UPW, then harden UPW:
        1.  Add these to `openlane/user_project_wrapper/config.json`:
            ```json
            "EXTRA_LIBS": "dir::../../lib/top_ew_algofoogle.lib",
            "EXTRA_SPEFS": [

                "dir::../../spef/multicorner/top_ew_algofoogle.max.spef"
            ],
            ```
            **ALSO** make sure this file DOES have `"dir::../../verilog/rtl/defines.v",` as part of VERILOG_FILES but **NOT** part of VERILOG_FILES_BLACKBOX. Make sure too that VERILOG_FILES_BLACKBOX uses only `gl/` files, i.e.:
            ```json
            "VERILOG_FILES_BLACKBOX": [
                "dir::../../verilog/gl/top_ew_algofoogle.v"
            ],
            ```
            Optionally also increase `ROUTING_CORES`.
        2.  ```bash
            make user_project_wrapper
            ```

            Can we fix it by:
            *   Re-hardening top_ew_algofoogle with faster clock constraint and slack margins.
                *   [Margins used by TT05](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt05-factory-test/blob/901461a50ef7aeda53262e030f4511c072ff5bf8/src/config.tcl#L21-L23) (these are an 'overfix' beyond getting from negative to 0):
                    ```tcl
                    # Hold slack margin - Increase them in case you are getting hold violations.
                    set ::env(PL_RESIZER_HOLD_SLACK_MARGIN) 0.1
                    set ::env(GLB_RESIZER_HOLD_SLACK_MARGIN) 0.05
                    ```
                    Doco:
                    *   `PL_RESIZER_HOLD_SLACK_MARGIN`:
                        >   Specifies a time margin for the slack when fixing hold violations. Normally the resizer will stop when it reaches zero slack. This option allows you to overfix. (Default: 0.1ns.)
                    *   I'm getting 895 hold violations ranging from -0.33 to -2.22 (avg appears to be about -1.2)
                    *   They all appear to be on LAs: 64, 66-68, 74-78, 84, 89, 91, 111, 112
                *   I will try doubling those margins to see how we go:
                    *   ```json
                        "CLOCK_PERIOD": 35.0,
                        "PL_RESIZER_HOLD_SLACK_MARGIN": 0.2,
                        "GLB_RESIZER_HOLD_SLACK_MARGIN": 0.1,
                        ```
                *   Antennas is *better* but still a couple of bad ones (4.03x and 2.61x).
                *   Slew is slightly worse (1.09/0.75)
                *   Fanout is slightly better (worst is 15)

Hi @Pawel, I've got an updated version of my design. I hope you don't mind including it.
* As usual, all the hardened files are in my repo: https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero-caravel
* Also, there's an updated snippet: https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero/blob/ew/src/rtl/ew_caravel_snippets/SNIPPET2_ShareIns.v

Thanks!

@Ellen, a reminder that you might want to check the things I found during a review of your implementation: https://github.com/algofoogle/journal/blob/master/0171-2023-11-03.md#antons-checks-of-pawels-repo-and-hardening -- Pawel has already identified that some don't matter, but the main points you might want to check on that page for more detail are:
* 2 (PWM pins using MGMT GPIO config)
* 3 (analog_io[4] aka DIGITAL[11] not connected)
* 4 (wb_sel_i not in macro)



# TODO

*   Find out whether other SoC pins can also be used by me for gpout[4] and gpout[5] when *not otherwise* used for SoC functions (e.g. is it a simple matter of making them MGMT-controlled when they are to perform their SoC function, and then switch to USER mode for my output function?)
*   Swap Anton's and Pawel's pins to place them respectively closer to where their macros need to be?
*   Consider using spare Ellen input (35) as clock source instead of user_clock2, or maybe IO[11] is now available?
*   Try to document actual PLL registers. What do the 'sel' registers actually do?? Add in clocking diagrams, and copies of simulation behaviour
*   Help Ellen with weird bus index numbering issues?
*   Last-minute fixes to my TT05 design:
    *   Enable QSPI part -- optionally with buffering too?
    *   Check resolution options.
    *   Option to switch between un/reg outputs
    *   Manually-inserted delay cells
*   TT05 analog design:
    *   Harald Pretl's 'custom cells' method?
    *   Design an 8-step potentiometric DAC (multiple cells even) -- in fact, it could be a *piece* of one and they can be chained for more division resolution.
    *   Use it to test gate threshold.
