# TT04 and general Verilog/FPGA project ideas

## Better ideas

For now, better ideas are those which:
*   I kinda already know how to implement; or
*   I can test easily enough (inc. on FPGA and other readily-available hardware); or
*   I can learn from structured guides.

Examples of better ideas:
*   SPI slave that shows on a VGA display how many writes it received in the last frame.
    Can be used to test SPI speed via RP2040 master.
*   solo_squash, with optional SPI control, including other configurable parameters
    and maybe better graphics (e.g. RGB222).
*   Proper SPI device that implements both MOSI and MISO.
*   Something that interacts with an external RAM or ROM.
*   UART device.
*   Individual components/POCs of Raybox?
    *   Reciprocal approximator, but maybe pulled down from Q12.12 until it fits.
        Original Q6.10 (or whatever it was) didn't fit in what was then a larger tile size!
        Might end up having to go for something like Q7.7.
    *   Simple column renderer, possibly reading from an external trace buffer for a resolution
        of 256x128 (or even 320x128), using a 2-wire clocked address, and reading 8 bits:
        6 for height, 1 for side (shade), 1 for colour. If we can squeeze in two consecutive
        reads per pixel, we can even get 16 bits, for 320x240: 7 bits for height, 1 for side,
        3 for colour, 5 for texture column??


## Ideas for later

The following are a little harder to assess, implement, and test...

*   Level shifter device, designed for vintage hardware interface.
*   VGA display that uses dual QPSI chips (RAM or ROM) in order to read a full "framebuffer",
    e.g. 4 dedicated inputs, 4 bidi as inputs, could read RGB332... maybe at 320w?
*   NES cartridge chip that can interface with an ESP8266, like my project to do it with STM32F103.
*   I was going to try an 8-bit serially-addressible RAM for TT04, but I got hung up on specs
    and realised it might be a little clunky to use, and have only a very small amount of
    storage in a single tile.
