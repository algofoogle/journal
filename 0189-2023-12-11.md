# GFMPW-1 finalisation

*   Reharden all:
    ```bash
    make top_design_mux         &&
    make top_raybox_zero_fsm    &&
    make urish_simon_says       &&
    make user_proj_cpu          &&
    make wrapped_wb_hyperram    &&
    make user_project_wrapper
    ```
    *   It takes about 45 minutes for the lot on L7, 48 on L5.
    *   There are (known) hold vios confined to LA-based reset lines. `./ammsum.sh` reports 651 hold vios: 163 worst -0.49 on LA55 (0:trzf1), 457 worst **-0.81** on LA56 (1:trzf2), 5 worst -0.38 on LA59 (4:uri).
*   Check LVS config
*   Delete junk projects from `openlane/`
*   Put in Anton's vgasp and solos designs, or stubs at least: Will it fix OEB vios?
*   Tidy up mux:
    *   Reduce `io_in` counts to match the needs of each design.
        *   Includes changing the simple repeater wire assignments inside the mux.
        *   NOTE: It might be troublesome for designs that define all io_ins (e.g. Uri's)... because even if they're unused, will they still yield LVS errors? Hopefully less likely if 
    *   Change pin packing. Try to work out a grid model?? No, that seems like a bad idea.
*   Put in everyone's doco in README

# Anton's extra designs

Bring in top_solo_squash and top_vga_spi_rom...

*   Branch FROM gf180-uri: `git checkout -b gf180-anton34 gf180-uri`
*   `git submodule update --init --recursive`
*   `git submodule add git@github.com:algofoogle/solo_squash verilog/rtl/solo_squash`
*   Just copy in the code from https://github.com/algofoogle/tt05-vga-spi-rom into `verilog/rtl/vga_spi_rom`


*   It looks like it might be possible to create a specific pin placement "pad ring" using [padringer.py](https://web.open-source-silicon.dev/t/8354024/https-github-com-the-openroad-project-openlane-pull-1601-160); see [`FP_PADFRAME_CFG`](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane/blob/master/docs/source/reference/configuration.md#user-content-fp_padframe_cfg).

# Testing misnamed wires in UPW

Ref: [Misnamed `trzf2_clock_in` and `trzf2_reset`](https://github.com/algofoogle/algofoogle-multi-caravel/blob/b5ef99467ccb42e34f8a9ffa7ead7a94f1b26d46/verilog/rtl/user_project_wrapper.v#L230-L231). These are not declared anywhere. They should raise an error, because otherwise my design has no clock connected! This was discovered by looking at the GDS.

*   I'm using `afmc-efabless` on `gf180` branch
*   I'm proving that a `make user_project_wrapper` works OK first: `23_12_11_15_42`
*   Then I will try to change TRZF2 to use the same misnamed wires as above, and reharden UPW: `23_12_11_15_54`
*   Assuming it succeeds, I will scour the run dir to look for the bad name: `trzf2_clock_in` -- if that doesn't find it, I will pick another more exotic PORT name, give it a bad wire, and then look for that port name in the run logs.
*   **NOTE:** LINTER MIGHT BE DISABLED! I didn't see any linter output. **YEP, linter is disabled:** [`"RUN_LINTER": 0`](https://github.com/algofoogle/algofoogle-multi-caravel/blob/b5ef99467ccb42e34f8a9ffa7ead7a94f1b26d46/openlane/user_project_wrapper/config.json#L96) this [comes from the original efabless/caravel_user_project repo at tag gfmpw-1d](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project/blob/2cc8a0166b02b9ca3c277f5c8d6f8446e61fc7a3/openlane/user_project_wrapper/config.json#L77).
*   After scouring the logs, looking for what warning these wires hopefully produced:
    *   Document where to find the warnings, and add to Tip 2312B checks
    *   Try running the harden again with linting turned on, and then check for any OTHER errors too.


Here is where warnings show up about `trzf2_clock_in`:

```
$ fgrep -R trzf2_clock_in *

logs/synthesis/1-synthesis.log:/home/zerotoasic/anton/afmc-efabless/openlane/user_project_wrapper/../../verilog/rtl/user_project_wrapper.v:254: Warning: Identifier `\trzf2_clock_in' is implicitly declared.

# Updating flat gf180 branch

Try this:

*   Go into `afmc-efabless`
*   `git remote -vv` -- verify which one is efabless (let's assume: `ef`)
*   `git fetch ef`
*   `git fetch github` -- or whatever
*   `git checkout gf180-anton34 && git pull`
*   `git checkout gf180 && git pull`
*   Find out what git fast-forward (and `--no-ff`) means
*   To check what a merge from gf180-anton34 into gf180 would be like: https://www.janbasktraining.com/community/devops/is-there-a-git-merge-dry-run-option
    *   I expect the biggest issue will be either the integration of submodules, including:
        *   Will the flattened submodules play nice with incoming gf180-anton34, or be seen as a conflict because of the paths coexisting?
        *   Will the `.gitmodules` file be a mess, leading to split brain?
    *   Besides that, maybe some merge conflicts
*   If necessary, just start a NEW branch of efabless and repeat the flattening of submodules

# TODO

*   Logo
*   Die layout graphic
*   ~~Some of Pawel's WB lines are on the fringe of being too long as antennas (several ~200%).~~ FIXED. Moved it a little closer to WB.
*   If we're having trouble with RESET hold vios, can we change its own special delay (or add one if missing), since it doesn't come directly from wb_rst_i anyway
    *   We could also mess with this line, as Pawel did:
        ```tcl
        set_input_delay [expr $::env(CLOCK_PERIOD) * 0.35 + 1] -clock [get_clocks {clk}] [get_ports {wb_rst_i}]
        ```
        ...since it does seem extreme that the reset delay default is HALF (`*0.5`) a clock period...?
*   Check yesterday's TODOs.
*   Get rid of `ena` lines in mux.
*   Reduce total number of IOs that top_vga_spi_rom needs -- since that is my own wrapper anyway, I can delete some unused pins, e.g. even name them correctly according to their function, get rid of OEBs that are not needed, and get rid of one-sided "uio"s.
*   AFTERWARDS: Use all the links in the submitted README to see if documentation can be tidied up, e.g. to use Anton's more-detailed RBZ notes about SPI, etc.


# Notes

*   NOTE: If we had to, could we use [`QUIT_ON_TIMING_VIOLATIONS`](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project/commit/4cf32f6d0954c2aca0b7a0d8658462932af26b0c#diff-fc7bfa78ff9a44fe9485a3c9354bc4a08080a0067cb5d5d025f337bb8396e025R78)?
*   Had to make sure that, for any IOs which have `io_out` connected, there was at least one corresponding case where the respective `io_oeb` could be pulled low to drive the output. Otherwise, the LVS check fails with an OEB error. One design was using `io_in[7:6]` and setting the corresponding `io_oeb[7:6]` both to 1 (i.e. always inputs), but it also had `io_out[7:6]` also driven... LVS didn't like this, so I decided to leave all `io_out[7:0]` disconnected completely in UPW, since none of our designs use them as outputs.
*   To make tests work we need to remove includes from these files:
    ```
    src/rtl/debug_overlay.v
    src/rtl/lzc.v
    src/rtl/pov.v
    src/rtl/rbzero.v
    src/rtl/spi_registers.v
    src/rtl/wall_tracer.v
    ```

# Getting this up to efabless

*   There are still hold violations. I will try to commit and submit anyway, and get the precheck/tapeout jobs running, then try to fix (or suppress) the hold vios later. They're probably not vital... they relate to LA-based individual resets, and while they'd be nice to have, there is still the option of external reset via `io_in[5]` and system-wide `wb_rst_i` propagation.
*   To do this, I need to:
    *   Flatten all of the submodules into the repo as regular directories/files, and *commit* them.
