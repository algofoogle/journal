# Pico-DE0 client

Continuing the Python [pico_deo client](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/tree/master/pi_pico/pico-de0/client):

*   Slightly better-structured command/read cycle.
*   Seems to work, though it is a bit slow: Typically 2ms between commands.
    For Raybox purposes, a "bit-banging" approach at this speed would allow
    only about 8 commands per frame, and this is probably too slow.
    Might need special combo commands, then, and a way to attach them to
    interrupts.


# Notes

*   Can we use [CircuitPython and usb_cdc](https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/shared-bindings/usb_cdc/index.html).
*   Would've been nice to come across [rp2daq](https://github.com/FilipDominec/rp2daq) early on.
*   Try disabling CRLF conversion. See [here](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/issues/7479#issuecomment-1216759103) which should refer to [this](https://github.com/FilipDominec/rp2daq/blob/9444db9fd02c36e15d23537ff5398544170416d3/rp2daq.c#L127).
*   Try overclocking RP2040 to 250MHz and see if it improves USB speed.
    [This gave me the idea](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/issues/7479).
*   Why am I finding PySerial slow? Is it PySerial itself (and maybe just
    the speed of interpreted Python); or the approach I'm taking with it
    (inc. bin/ASCII conversion); or the USB speed; or the RP2040 speed?
    Could even be [internal USB buffering](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_serial.html#txbuffer)
    so maybe we need to find a way to make PySerial do a [flush](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyserial_api.html#serial.Serial.flush) at the end
    of each command, as well as make the RP2040 firmware do the same
    for each response.
*   Is PySerial's [`read_until`](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyserial_api.html#serial.Serial.read_until) likely to be any faster than `readline()`, which maybe includes a timeout for CRLF or something?
*   [Some thoughts on improving PySerial throughput](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56240817),
    but I think this is more for handling long data streams (esp. bulk reads)
    rather than the command/response stuff we need.
*   Though there's an option to specify serial baud rate, it appears to be ignored
    when using USB-Serial (i.e. USB-CDC).
    [An example](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_serial.html)
    (though for Arduino, not Pico) suggests:
    >   ```c
    >   Serial.begin(9600); // USB is always 12 or 480 Mbit/sec
    >   ```
*   NOTE: Opening USB-serial at 1200 baud specifically seems to be an intentionally-designed
    way to reset the RP2040 to BOOTSEL mode.

*   Notes on possible [direct USB-to-USB](https://medium.com/geekculture/serial-connection-between-raspberry-pi-and-raspberry-pico-d6c0ba97c7dc) instead of USB-CDC?
