# Changing vga_cursor to SPI

*   I'm going to try making vga_cursor accept [SPI-style updates][SPI]:
    *   SPI is typically a "4-wire" interface.
    *   My implementation will use probably 3:
        *   `SCLK`: Serial Clock; rising edge means "load another bit".
        *   `MOSI`: Master Out Sale In, sometimes also called `SDI` (Serial Data In); data being sent from host controller to our slave device.
        *   `/SS`: Slave Select (active low);
    *   For now we don't need `MISO` (i.e. "read" access, or return data).
    *   A data transaction that completes (i.e. host controller starting and finishing a single
        complete transmission of a command, or data, or whtever) is usually called a "frame".
    *   In SPI, data is usually shifted out MSB first.
*   What are *typical* ways of ensuring synchronisation, i.e. returning to a "let's start talking"
    state, in case things get out of order? I suppose that's one advantage of using addressed
    registers rather than sequential writes.
    *   I'm going to define the falling edge of `/SS` to be the start of a frame.
        This is consistent with [this comment][SSFalling]:
        >   Some slaves require a falling edge of the chip select signal to initiate an action.

        i.e. I will make the design reset its input controller when `/SS` goes low, abandoning a frame
        that was in progress (if any) and starting a new one.
*   Different SPI implementations could be;
    *   Write one long status update word ("frame") of 19+ bits.
    *   Write a 4-bit or 8-bit command, followed by a number of bits specific to the command.
    *   Always use 8 bits, e.g. 8-bit command followed by 8-bit data.
    *   Always send (say) an 8-bit address word, followed by an 8-bit data word.
*   If this works out, it could be adapted to 8 bits at a time (typical CPU bus) either with
    adressed registers (i.e. `A0..A?`) or a known number of sequential writes to form an expected
    command or state update.
*   For now I think it best to take a synchronous approach for crossing clock domains,
    i.e. `SCLK` sync'd to the design's internal clock.
    *   Let's assume a reduced version of this design might ultimately target 320x240 (or 320x480)
        resolution, so a 12.5MHz pixel/system clock.
    *   If we're oversampling `SCLK`, I think worst-case would be &div;5, or a 2.5MHz max SPI clock.
    *   If we're talking about Raybox's needs in the future, then we need to send perhaps up to
        192 bits per VGA frame refresh. 2.5MHz&div;192 is ~13,000 SPI transmissions per second, or
        on the order of (at worst) at least 150 updates per VGA frame. That's way more than we need :)
    *   If we are assuming a very old CPU controlling this, though, then consider a 6502 clocked at
        about 1MHz, having to bit-bang it. It might only be able to send on the order of (at worst)
        100,000 bits per second, or as low as 1,100 bits per VGA frame. Still plenty though :)
