# Tip 2406A: Generating PNG images/renders of GDS in KLayout using Ruby macros

*   Frame your view to the features you want. KLayout exports the current view.
*   F5 to go into the Developer window
*   Use this to generate a PNG of maximum resolution that Photoshop supports:
    ```ruby
    RBA::Application.instance.main_window.current_view.save_image("/tmp/macro.png",16000,16000)
    ```
