# Tip 2312B: Stuff to remember for GFMPW-1 submission

*   Different power nets! If doing 'original' raybox-zero without FSM, don't forget to change `top_ew_algofoogle` to use `vdd` and `vss`.
*   Check all logs and warnings, inc. deep yosys stuff.
*   Try to find any examples of disconnected pins/nets. Deliberately feed an error in to see how to find it?
*   Go thru the same checks I did for EW.
*   Put in all the SPDX stuff.
*   Zoom the GDS and check that each macro actually has all expected pins connected.
