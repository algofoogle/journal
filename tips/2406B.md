# Tip 2406B: Caravel Secrets

This will probably be an ongoing list of things I discover about the inner workings and detailed proper use of the Caravel SoC.

*   Setting just *some* GPIO config via firmware (e.g. anything involving `reg_mprj_xfer = 1`) may *not* retain all `user_defines.v` defaults and might (for any not explicitly set in the same firmware) instead use housekeeping defaults: [Ref](https://open-source-silicon.slack.com/archives/C01EX4ATEKF/p1671766603691739?thread_ts=1671759211.054939&cid=C01EX4ATEKF).
    *   Thus, it is better to ensure you write to **all** GPIO config registers, to be sure you know what you're getting.
    *   NOTE: This could possibly have changed in more recent Caravels, but I don't yet know.
    *   By this logic, it might also not be possible to read the existing **true** GPIO configuration, since instead we'd just be reading the housekeeping registers...?
*   Many GPIO cell diagrams (

    [4](https://github.com/efabless/caravel/blob/main/docs/source/_static/gpio_function.jpg)
    ) show that an IO pad feeds back into the user project area directly (or at least through an always-on buffer), but I haven't yet been able to confirm this.
    *   Some people have said the input buffer may be user-area tri-stated in default configurations (e.g. for `GPIO[4:0]`, or at least for `GPIO[1:0]`).
    *   [Skywater `inp_dis` doco](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/contents/libraries/sky130_fd_io/docs/user_guide.html#independent-control-of-input-and-output-buffer-enables) supports this 'input buffer disable' idea.
    *   [Skywater's gpiov2 diagram](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/contents/libraries/sky130_fd_io/docs/user_guide.html#sky130-fd-io-gpiov2-additional-features) also suggests the input logic is more complicated.
