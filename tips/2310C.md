# Tip 2310C: Checks to do on final chipIgnite submission

These are just notes for myself: Checks I need to remember to do to be sure my chipIgnite submission is good to go...

*   Which version of OpenLane should I be using?
*   Look for antenna violations: `(VIOLATED)`
*   Check setup/hold margins
*   Regular simulation
*   Caravel firmware
*   GL simulation
*   Account for every input, output, and oeb
*   Make sure my `oeb`s match the polarity of the intended target. Matt prefers 1=output, Caravel has a mix of 0=out and 1=out.
*   Scour `logs/synthesis/1-synthesis.log` for warnings/errors
*   Look at GDS in KLayout and make sure every pin is wired up sensibly
*   Check CTS
*   Make sure we're using correct directives in `config.tcl`
*   Make sure RESET definitely suspends **all switching**, even if we still have a clock coming in. This is to make sure we don't create noise for other designs on the chip (esp. analog ones).
*   Implement safe reset lock using XOR method via LA.
*   Work out correct clock source. Is it `user_clock2`? Make sure `CLOCK_PORT` and `CLOCK_NET` are set correctly!
*   Check `FP_PIN_ORDER_CFG`
