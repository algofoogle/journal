# Tip 2310C: Checks to do on final chipIgnite submission

These are just notes for myself: Checks I need to remember to do to be sure my chipIgnite submission is good to go...

*   Look for antenna violations: `(VIOLATED)`
*   Check setup/hold margins
*   Regular simulation
*   GL simulation
*   Account for every input, output, and oeb
*   Make sure my `oeb`s match the polarity of the intended target. Matt prefers 1=output, Caravel has a mix of 0=out and 1=out.
*   Scour `logs/synthesis/1-synthesis.log` for warnings/errors
*   Look at GDS in KLayout and make sure every pin is wired up sensibly
*   Check CTS
*   Make sure we're using correct directives in `config.tcl`
