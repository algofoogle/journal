# Tip 2310B: Setting up cocotb and iverilog on Windows

## Prerequisites

*   _NOTE: I started this in [0152](../0152-2023-10-04.md) and picked it up again in [0156](../0156-2023-10-10.md#automated-tests)._
*   I'm using Windows 11 Home
*   I had already set up MSYS2/MinGW, and I think [this is what I did when using my Legion 7 laptop](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero#running-verilator-simulation-on-windows).
*   I set up Python 3.12 per [2310A](./2310A.md).

Test basic stuff:
*   Check PATH. In Command Prompt just run `path`. In PowerShell, run `echo $env:path`. Make sure MSYS2/MingGW bin dirs are in there. For example, on my machine:
    `PATH=`...`;C:\msys64\usr\bin;C:\msys64\mingw64\bin;C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin;`...
*   `make --version`
    ```

    ...
    ```
*   `py --version` => `Python 3.12.0`
*   `py -m pip --version` => `pip 23.2.1 from C:\`...` (python 3.12)`
*   `gcc --version`
    ```
    gcc.exe (Rev1, Built by MSYS2 project) 13.2.0

    ```
*   `pacman --version`
    ```

## Steps

### cocotb

1.  Create a .venv in your project, if you want, and optionally give it a specific prompt (like `venv:myproject`). For example:
    *   Using VSCode:
        1.  <kbd>CTRL+SHIFT+P</kbd>, find 'Python: Create Environment'
        2.  Choose 'Venv'
        3.  If you're using a workspace with multiple projects, choose the project in which you want to make the .venv
        4.  Select your Python interpreter
        5.  Right-click your project and open a new Integrated Terminal; Activate.ps1 should automatically run and `(.venv)` will be in the prompt.
    *   Using the `venv` command:
        1.  Go into your project directory.
        2.  Run `py -m venv .venv --prompt venv:myproject`
        3.  Do: `echo '*' >> .venv\.gitignore`
        4.  Run `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
2.  Before installing the `cocotb` package directly, check first whether there's a `requirements.txt` file that includes it.
    *   If so, just run `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
    *   **Otherwise**, run: `py -m pip install cocotb`

### iverilog

This assumes you've got `pacman` installed (my `--version` is 6.0.2) which probably came as part of MSYS2 (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)).

I'm following from [here](https://iverilog.fandom.com/wiki/Installation_Guide#Windows).

1.  List available versions of iverilog by running: `pacman -Ss iverilog`:
    ```
    > pacman -Ss iverilog
    mingw32/mingw-w64-i686-iverilog 1~11.0.r9168.gd480c4d7-1 (mingw-w64-i686-eda)
        Icarus Verilog, is a Verilog simulation and synthesis tool (mingw-w64)
    mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-iverilog 1~11.0.r9168.gd480c4d7-1 (mingw-w64-x86_64-eda)
        Icarus Verilog, is a Verilog simulation and synthesis tool (mingw-w64)
    ucrt64/mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-iverilog 1~11.0.r9168.gd480c4d7-1 (mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-eda)
        Icarus Verilog, is a Verilog simulation and synthesis tool (mingw-w64)
    ```
2.  Choose the version you want to install. Which one was right for me? When I originally set up MSYS2, it seems I settled on making 'MSYS2 UCRT64' my default shell, so I'll go with the ucrt64 version, though apparently you might be able to install all 3.
3.  Install the package for your chosen version, e.g. `pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-iverilog`
4.  After this, `iverilog.exe` was not in my PATH, but I was able to run it from my MSYS2 UCRT64 shell, and evidently its path is:
    *   Windows path: `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin\iverilog.exe`
    *   Equivalent Unix path: `/ucrt64/bin/iverilog`
    So edit Windows env vars and make sure PATH includes your path to `...\ucrt64\bin`. I already had `C:\msys64\usr\bin` and `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin` but had to add `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin`.
5.  Re-launch any shells/terminals. For VSCode, this probably means relaunching the whole app.
6.  Run `iverilog -V` and it will hopefully spit out version info:
    ```
    > iverilog -V
    Icarus Verilog version 12.0 (devel) (s20150603-1391-gd480c4d7d)
    ...
    ```

### gtkwave

1.  Search: `pacman -Ss gtkwave`
2.  Let's go with ucrt64 version again: `pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gtkwave`
3.  Test: `gtkwave`
4.  GTKWave might appear blurry or oversized if High DPI is used in Windows. While GTKWave is running, right-click it in the taskbar, go to Properties => Compatibility => Settings => Change high DPI settings => then tick `Override high DPI scaling behavior` and set `Scaling performed by:` to `Application`. Launch it again, and it should look much clearer and at a normal size.
5.  Create a `.gtkwaverc` file. For Windows, per the [GTKWave documentation PDF] we actually need to create a file called `gtkwave.ini` in the *current working directory* (say, of your project, where your VCD file will be written):
    ```
    # ~/.gtkwaverc

    # Use, for example, the following for generic monospaced-fonts:
    # fontname_signals Monospace 15

    fontname_waves Consolas 9

    # By making signal names larger, we can make the waveforms taller too:
    fontname_signals Consolas 15

    splash_disable 1
    fill_waveform 1
    disable_mouseover 0

    # Grid lines are pale blue:
    color_grid 336699

    # Z values are light purple:
    color_mid bb33ff
    ```
    NOTE: You can override this by supplying the `-r YourRCFile` option to gtkwave. For more gtkwaverc examples, including defining custom hotkeys, see [this](https://github.com/mballance/egtkwave/blob/master/gtkwave/gtkwave-3.3.52/examples/gtkwaverc).
