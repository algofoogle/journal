# tt05-vga-spi-rom improvements

# Accomplishments

*   Adjusted to send SPI read preamble before visible end of line.
*   Now up to full 128-bits (16 bytes) storage. Even try more and see if still fits in 1x1.


# Goals

*   Implement cocotb/verilator and add in Claire Wolf's spiflash so we can prove it works in sim.
*   Rework posedge/negedge and byte bars, with registers for start/stop.
*   SMELL: RESET signal should drive SPI /CS high and keep it high until the next valid sequence starts.
*   Test out extra RGB333 range. Show colour bars/palette in otherwise unused screen area?
*   Ensure that RGB111, RGB222, RGB333 all give results that can be visually interpreted.

# Stretch

*   DPI/QPI
*   Delay line
*   Attempt re-display of data as mapped to [tiny hex characters](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10W6RaZFFKiEBgWBWMpl-wNXEygXAUvypYUgx8fy_Z80/edit#gid=811511442) -- do colour pairs for bytes.
*   For interest, besides just more inputs to switch things, try periodically incrementing the address high bits. Have a way to control the speed, and it could be an animation! Even have the option to let the *data* in the SPI ROM specify the delay, or have an actual data stream elsewhere in the ROM that specifies which 'frames' to display, in what order, with what timing.

# Automated Tests

Throwing back to [0152](./0152-2023-10-04.md), I've got Python installed. Now I need:
*   cocotb
*   iverilog
