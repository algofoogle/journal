# Raybox

*   Tried for a while today to see if I could get it to synthesise using OpenLane, set to an
    area (2900&micro;m &times; 3500&micro;m) that is almost a Caravel fit. The synth succeeded
    after several failed attempts (and in the end setting `PL_TARGET_DENSITY` to 10% got it there),
    but it has thousands of timing violations. More optimisation could be attempted later, but
    the design isn't finished yet.
*   I found that negative bit indices in Verilog seem to trigger a bug in the LVS step of OpenLane,
    i.e. an "unmatched pin" error occurs. I will try to report this later, but for now I worked
    around it by making sure any fixed-point IO pins just start at a bit index of 0.
*   I merged the `sprites` branch into the `main` branch. I will do more work later on trying to
    support more than 1 sprite.

# Next steps

*   Need to fix codebase (namely wall textures) to work with fixed-point values other than Q12.12.
*   Support 64x64 map with more data depth (i.e. different textures, even if hard-coded for now).
*   Find out if OpenLane can use multiple CPU cores.
*   Work out how to send control data to the FPGA.
*   Start working on resource sharing. Prove that it actually simplifies the design.
    *   Need to get solid metrics from OpenLane/Yosys before making changes!
    *   Check utilisation also in Quartus; beware multiplier blocks!
    *   Need to also check timing, inc. both FPGA reports and OpenSTA.
*   Consider modularising some blocks and hardening them independently. Might help speed up optimisation/hardening, and get a better fit.
    Should also make code more readable and configurable, e.g. have a specific sprite rendering module.
*   Find out how to define actual RAM blocks
*   Learn OpenRAM
*   Test whether Q16.16 or even just Q12.16 gives better texture stability.
*   Try a reduced design in OpenLane and see if we can get it to fit AND RUN (in sim, then FPGA):
    *   Reduce ROMs:
        *   Reduce textures/sprite to 32x32. This will quarter their ROM data.
        *   Alternatively, do simple ROMs as boolean logic (bitwise operations).
        *   Make ROMs external (and serviced by other modules/TBs). It should ultimately be like this anyway.
    *   Do a 320x240 version.
    *   Drop fixed-point stuff to Q9.9
    *   Comment out sprite(s).
*   Optimising to get the design to fit in Caravel without compromising:
    *   Sprite positions probably only need ~6 bits of sub-unit precision. In fact, they only need about Q6.6 (unsigned)?
    *   Player position could be reduced to Q6.12 (unsigned)?
    *   Facing and vplane vectors could be reduced to Q2.12 (signed). This allows vectors in the range [-2.0,2.0)
    *   Trace buffer could be converted to OpenRAM.
    *   Fewer IOs
    *   Implement shared resources (i.e. for reciprocals and multiplication)
    *   Plan/implement external ROMs
