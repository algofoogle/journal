## Achievements

*   Fixed the tracing glitch, yay!
*   Also seems to improve the FPGA memory glitch (though there are still timing errors)
*   Q16.16 is working well
*   Pictures needed:
    *   FPGA setup
    *   FPGA glitching - anim gif?
    *   Wall edge glitch before and after

## Next steps

*   Next need to see if we can drop Q16.16 a bit, to maybe Q8.12? Make `lzc` and `reciprocal` support different bit depths. I've made most of the fixed-point stuff generic/parametric, but there are still some errors somewhere if not using Q16.16.
*   Fix FPGA player position reset. Why does it (seemingly) go to (0,0)?
*   Implement rotation, even if done externally on frame start, for now -- clock domains!
    *   Try mouse integration via Verilator/SDL. Will this work with VirtualBox?
*   Optimise tracer state machine
*   Fix full screen width: Either hardcoded 640-division or just 1024-division with range limit.
*   Trace buffer ring memory
*   Different wall type IDs (just 2-bit colour for now)
*   Further investigate FPGA timing

## Bigger picture

*   Textures
*   Sprites
*   Doors
*   Collisions
*   Make chip able to be configured to support higher (or lower) resolutions:
    *   640x480-based: 512x480, 512x400, 512x384, 320x480, 320x240, or 320x200.
    *   800x600-based: 800x600, 400x600, 400x300
    *   1024x768 max
    *   NOTE: A higher resolution is still useful even without a wider trace buffer, because it gets better sync/quality on native resolution displays.
*   Faster parallel processing: Could simply double/interleave multiple tracers?
    Alternatively, have mirrored tracers (do pos/neg viewplane rays simultaneously).

# Notes

*   EDA Playground: https://edaplayground.com/x/AuPw
*   Good TBs, deep signals
*   WaveTrace VSCode extension
*   640x15 (9,600 bits): DFF shift RAM, or OpenRAM, or reram?
*   Watch OpenRAM video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUh-z4E542o
