# Rough notes for RBZ and TT06 Analog VGA testing prep

Through Nov and Dec I worked on some raybox-zero ("RBZ") design upgrades, and started preparing for the arrival of TT06 with my tt06-grab-bag project (analog VGA driver experiment). I also got a Digilent Analog Discovery 3 and started learning the basics of it. 

Because my TT06 project should produce analog (DAC) outputs in the range of 0 to 1.8V, but with a fairly weak signal, I need a solution to buffer it -- both to boost it, but also to protect the on-chip circuit. I spent some time learning about opamps, got a few samples, and did some simulations in KiCad (which internally uses ngspice) of what I hope will be an adequate circuit.

I haven't documented the full details yet, but my amplifier designs can at least be found in https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/tree/master/opamp -- currently a Private repo only, but if requested I can arrange to share these details. Note that I ended up selecting the TI OPA3355.

More documentation to come, but below is my ever-growing list of stuff I want to get done soon (while other things have dropped off the list).


## TODO V2

- [x] Create symbol for my RP2040 board (`sandpit/pcb/kicad/RP2040/rp2040_pcba_test`) showing its IOs, buttons/headers and LEDs
- [ ] Create schematic for GFMPW-1 hookup inc. RP2040 and TinyVGA
- [ ] Write "game" code for PC control of GFMPW-1, also TT07
- [ ] Write RP2040 (uPython or C) code to move "smartly" between random map locations as a cooler demo
- [x] Design/simulate opamp & VGA connector board for TT06, later TT08
- [ ] Update rbz repo with WB extensions, and improve register access instantiation
- [ ] Document rbz_options
- [ ] Document CI2409 RBZ
- [ ] Document CI2411 RBZ variants, esp. WB
- [ ] Test other GFMPW-1 designs
- [ ] GFMPW-1 clocked by RP2040 -- try different clock speeds
- [ ] Unexpected SPI overloading behaviour; doesn't stall SPI counter as it should?
      *   Compare reg SPI (over)load: https://github.com/algofoogle/algofoogle-multi-caravel/blob/gf180/verilog/rtl/raybox-zero-fsm/src/rtl/spi_registers.v
      *   Compare vec SPI (over)load
      *   Compare versions (TT04 and CI2311 work OK with both overloading??? Or maybe the don't: MicroPython SoftSPI maybe sends exact bits? Don't think so).
      *   Try a GFMPW vec SPI regular load, vs. overload
      *   Do a simulation of SPI loading & check VCD
- [ ] Document TT08 submission for analog review
- [ ] Try to get TT09 ring osc extraction/simulation to work


## Testing opamp circuit before TT06 arrival

*   Simulate devices that have usable SPICE models (e.g. from TI) -- Create warpper SPICE as required for multi-devices.
*   Generate high-impedance 0-1.8V analog signal from AD3:
    *   Waveform gen:
        *   Without BNC: -3dB at 9MHz
        *   With BNC: -3db at 12MHz
    *   Run it thru a 100k (or 1Meg) resistor?

```excel
(floor(X*32)%3<2) * (
  (floor(X*256) % 2) * sin(2*PI*X)/2 + X
)
```

Simulated opamp delay is about 10ns on rising edge:

...much faster on falling edge.
