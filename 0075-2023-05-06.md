Quick update tonight; didn't get a chance to work on anything today.

Next steps I'd like to look into are below...

**Need to work on prioritising these!**

*   Try playing Wolf3D again to see how it feels in movement speed, rotation, framerate. Keys vs. mouse.
*   Building for Caravel
*   Different wall IDs => just colours for now?
*   Fix FOV and render full screen width
*   Try out basic texturing -- calculate column-to-texture-Y. Use a generated texture for now, later ROM or RAM texture? Scaled stepping (try rayAddX method).
*   Implement ordered dither for more colours (but preview deeper colour depth first in sim).
*   Hardware for better directional controls, and even rotation (buttons and quadrature or PS/2 mouse)
*   Implement saturation logic to hopefully prevent axis alignment glitch
*   Make a rotation module on the FPGA, just to try it out
*   Screen XY transform: rotation to frame buffer to get a little jiggle
*   Controller (NIOS or external MCU or input via USB) for HID
*   Possible to send data from PC to DE0-Nano?
    *   Though old, maybe [vj-uart](http://idlelogiclabs.com/2014/07/12/virtual-com-port-connection-de0-nano-vj-uart/) will help? See also, [this](https://community.intel.com/t5/FPGA-SoC-And-CPLD-Boards-And/Communication-PC-De0-Nano/td-p/120898).
    *   If not, maybe USB-to-TTL-serial with serial implemented in hardware on FPGA? Would be great to see the sim sending data to the FPGA.
    *   Note that Terasic tools can do it...? GUI tool to control various peripherals?
*   Other hardware filling the role of the sim? e.g. STM32? Need to get that async (cross-domain) register load stuff going, in that case.
*   Clean up FSM and consider sharing a single reciprocal calculator.
*   Change trace buffer memory type?
*   Implement rectange overlay rendering
*   Is it possible to do line segment rendering via beam racing?
*   Basic text
*   Try to implement enough stuff that it can actually be a renderer for a Wolf3D-style game, running on an MCU.
    But does the game state need data from the chip, too, such as walk distance, collisions, and sprite distance?
*   Doors
*   Sprites
*   Collisions
*   Bigger map ROM support
