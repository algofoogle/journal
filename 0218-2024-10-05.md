# GFMPW-1 basic bring-up

## Basic connection and proof of life

To an extent, you can use the [chipIgnite Caravel eval board README](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_board/tree/5b44f382b1276531095d4cdf9c8bc0e7a19183f8/firmware/chipignite#readme) for information on the board layout (even though it's slightly different for GFMPW).

[0206](./0206-2024-06-26.md) has more detail about what I did with a non-gf180 board, and it's basically the same, but here's a high-level summary:

*   My host PC is Windows 11 Home.
*   I've got an Ubuntu 22.04 VM in VirtualBox.
*   Linux user must be part of the `dialout` group to access the FTDI USB-serial interface, so: `sudo adduser $USER dialout` -- then reboot the VM.
*   Remove the M.2 card screw from the board, insert an M.2 card (push in firmly to snap in), replace the screw gently.
*   Plugging the board into my host PC recognises it in Windows. Using VirtualBox, I do a "USB pass through" to my Linux VM of the device "`FTDI Single RS232-HS [0900]`" (and this can be made permanent).
*   When connecting the board to Linux, `sudo dmesg -T --follow` should reveal the device connecting.
*   Clone the [caravel_board](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_board) repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/efabless/caravel_board # 286MB
    cd caravel_board
    ```
*   Create a Python VENV:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv --prompt caravel_board .venv
    echo '*' >> .venv/.gitignore
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python3 --version # Python 3.10.12
    ```
*   Do: `pip3 install pyftdi`
*   Create a "mapping" for lower-level usermode control of the FTDI USB-serial device, i.e. run `lsusb` to get the VID:PID (probably `0403:6014`) and (as root) put into a new file called `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-ftdi-everyone.rules`:
    ```
    # Per https://groups.google.com/g/weewx-user/c/kol0udZNuyc/m/1WhtZF0kBAAJ
    # ...and https://github.com/algofoogle/journal/blob/master/0206-2024-06-26.md
    # ...this ensures all users get full access to the FTDI USB interface on
    # the caravel_board hardware, without having to be root:

    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0403", ATTR{idProduct}=="6014", MODE="666"
    ```
    ...then: `sudo service udev restart` and unplug and replug the board, and pass back thru to Linux VM (if necessary).
*   Try HKDebug:
    ```bash
    cd firmware/gf180/util
    python3 caravel_hkdebug.py
    ```
    ...and expect to see:
    ```
    Success: Found one matching FTDI device at ftdi://ftdi:232h:1:4/1
    Caravel data:
       mfg        = 0456
       product    = 20
       project ID = 1801dc4f
       project ID = f23b8018
    ```

## Reading GFMPW-1 Caravel registers

Caravel's HKSPI allows the FTDI chip to control it to read and write certain 'registers', which have a default power-on state.

In HKDebug (i.e. `python3 caravel_hkdebug.py`), option 1 will read the first 19 registers, and here is their power-on state decoded:

```
reg 0x00 = b'00'  reg_hkspi_status          UNDEFINED/RESERVED
reg 0x01 = b'04'  reg_hkspi_chip_id[19:16]  ...
reg 0x02 = b'56'  reg_hkspi_chip_id[15:8]   ...Manufacturer ID: 0x456 (Efabless)
reg 0x03 = b'20'  reg_hkspi_chip_id[7:0]    Product ID (0x20): Caravel on GF180?
reg 0x04 = b'f2'  reg_hkspi_user_id[31:24]  ...
reg 0x05 = b'3b'  reg_hkspi_user_id[23:16]  ...
reg 0x06 = b'80'  reg_hkspi_user_id[15:8]   ...
reg 0x07 = b'18'  reg_hkspi_user_id[7:0]    ...32b project ID (0x1801dc4f, reversed bits)
reg 0x08 = b'02'  reg_hkspi_pll_ena         xxxxxx_1_0 = Use manual DCO; Disable DCO
reg 0x09 = b'01'  reg_hkspi_pll_bypass      xxxxxxx_1 = Bypass enabled; use direct ext. clk
reg 0x0a = b'00'  reg_hkspi_irq             xxxxxxx_0 = No action
reg 0x0b = b'00'  reg_hkspi_reset           xxxxxxx_0 = No action
reg 0x0c = b'00'  reg_hkspi_trap            ??
reg 0x0d = b'ff'  reg_hkspi_pll_trim[7:0]   ...
reg 0x0e = b'ef'  reg_hkspi_pll_trim[15:8]  ...
reg 0x0f = b'ff'  reg_hkspi_pll_trim[23:16] ...
reg 0x10 = b'03'  reg_hkspi_pll_trim[25:24] ...trim is 0x03ffefff
reg 0x11 = b'12'  reg_hkspi_pll_source      xx_010_010 = div-2 for user_clock2 and wb_clk_i
reg 0x12 = b'04'  reg_hkspi_pll_divider     xxx_00100 = mul-4
```

Edit `caravel_hkdebug.py` to add this extra "option 15" to read ALL of the HKSPI address space:

```python
    elif k == '15':
        data = slave.exchange([CARAVEL_STREAM_READ, 0x00], 256)
        # Print header:
        print("   " + " ".join(f"-{i:x}" for i in range(16)))
        # Print data in hex format with 16 bytes per line:
        for i in range(0, len(data), 16):
            print(f"{i>>4:x}- ", end="")
            print(" ".join(f"{b:02X}" for b in data[i:i+16]))
```

Run HKDebug again and use option 15:

```

```

user_defines.v shows the meaning of GPIO config values that appear as 16 bit values (big-endian) starting at HKSPI register address 0x1d,0x1e (for GPIO 0) and continuing up to address 0x67,0x68 (for GPIO 37). Note that these power-on values are NOT the actual currently-configured state of the GPIOs [as defined in user_defines.v](https://github.com/algofoogle/algofoogle-multi-caravel/blob/19251b1d9f929e2b2e8c169404437b8a2398560e/verilog/rtl/user_defines.v#L53-L87); they are the values-in-waiting that WOULD be loaded as configuration on the next activation of the GPIO configuration shift register cycle.

## Checking the clock sources

*   There's a 10MHz oscillator on the Caravel eval board, feeding the clock input of the Caravel SoC. This can be measured via the `xclk` pin on the right-side header of the board.
*   The oscillator can be disabled, if needed; there is a header pin pair that can be shorted to do this -- it is near X1 (just below LED D1). When disabled, an external clock source can be provided via the `xclk` header pin on the right-side of the board. **However,** it's probably not necessary to do this as the on-board DLL can be used to get different clock speeds inside the chip.
*   Caravel has two internal clock sources: `wb_clk_i` (core clock, shared with the user project area and with the Caravel CPU) and `user_clock2` which can be split off from the core clock source using the DLL.
*   You can make Caravel output both clocks on GPIOs 14 and 15 respectively by using a series of register writes (with option 14) as follows:
    *   Enable clock outputs:
        *   Reg 0x1b, write data 6 (bit 1 is GPIO 14 clock output enable, bit 2 is GPIO 15 clock output enable).
    *   Configure GPIO 14 as a "management output" (GPIO_MODE_MGMT_STD_OUTPUT):
        *   Reg 0x39, write data 0
        *   Reg 0x3A, write data 0xb
    *   Repeat for GPIO 15:
        *   Reg 0x3B, write data 0
        *   Reg 0x3C, write data 0xb
    *   Activate the shift register that loads all GPIO config:
        *   Reg 0x13, write 1
*   It should now be possible to see 10MHz clock outputs on GPIOs 14 and 15 (with 14 probably very slightly lagging 15, i.e. by about 8ns).
*   If you want, you could now try writing to the Caravel DLL registers to test different clocks.

## Testing the Caravel CPU with basic blink firmware

*   The RISC-V toolchain needs to be installed, and I did that [as described here](https://github.com/algofoogle/journal/blob/master/0208-2024-07-05.md#firmware) (i.e. I did NOT follow the [instructions](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain) linked from [here](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_board/tree/5b44f382b1276531095d4cdf9c8bc0e7a19183f8/firmware/chipignite#install-toolchain-for-compiling-code)). In particular, I did this:
    ```bash
    sudo -s # Runs these commands below as root...
    cd /opt
    RISCVTOOLS=riscv64-unknown-elf-toolchain-10.2.0-2020.12.8-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14
    wget https://static.dev.sifive.com/dev-tools/freedom-tools/v2020.12/$RISCVTOOLS.tar.gz
    tar xf $RISCVTOOLS.tar.gz
    rm $RISCVTOOLS.tar.gz
    ln -s $RISCVTOOLS riscv-toolchain
    exit # Exit 'sudo' session.
    # Test:
    /opt/riscv-toolchain/bin/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc --version
    ```
*   Make a copy of the existing gf180 blink example in caravel_board:
    ```bash
    cd firmware/gf180
    cp -R blink basic-blink
    cd basic-blink
    ```
*   Replace `blink.c` with this minimal example, which intentionally does NOT attempt to reconfigure any of the GPIOs:
    ```c
    #include <defs.h>

    void delay(const int d)
    {
        // Configure timer for a single-shot countdown:
        reg_timer0_config = 0;
        reg_timer0_data = d;
        reg_timer0_config = 1;
        // Loop, waiting for value to reach zero:
        reg_timer0_update = 1;  // latch current value
        while (reg_timer0_value > 0) {
            reg_timer0_update = 1;
        }
    }

    void main()
    {
        // Configure Caravel's own "gpio" pin as an output:
        reg_gpio_mode1 = 1;
        reg_gpio_mode0 = 0;
        reg_gpio_ien = 1;
        reg_gpio_oeb = 0;

        while (1) {
            reg_gpio_out = 1;   // LED D3 OFF
            delay(2000000);
            reg_gpio_out = 0;   // LED D3 ON
            delay(2000000);
        }
    }
    ```
*   Replace `Makefile` by doing: `cp ../../chipignite/demos/Makefile .` -- Note that, importantly, this Makefile specifies that the target RISC-V architecture is RV32I (via `-march=rv32i`)
*   Edit this new `Makefile` to ensure:
    *   `TOOLCHAIN_PATH` is set to `/opt/riscv-toolchain/bin/`
    *   The line setting `PATTERN = demos` is replaced with `PATTERN = blink`
    *   Any references to `demos` are replaced with `$(PATTERN)`
*   Compile and flash this blink firmware to the Caravel board's SPI Flash ROM by doing: `make flash`
    *   NOTE: While the flash is being erased and then programmed, LED D2 should be lit and D1 should blink.
*   LED D3 should blink after that.

## Testing the mux

*   Inside caravel_board, create `firmware/gf180/mux_test/`:
    *   Copy in `Makefile` from above (and modify it to set `PATTERN = mux_test`)
    *   Copy in [mux_tests.c from algofoogle-multi-caravel repo](https://github.com/algofoogle/algofoogle-multi-caravel/blob/gf180/verilog/dv/mux_tests/mux_tests.c) as `mux_test.c` (NOTE: There's [a newer version of this file](https://github.com/algofoogle/algofoogle-multi-caravel/blob/gf180/verilog/dv/cocotb/mux_test/mux_test.c) but it relies on `firmware_apis.h` which I don't yet know how to *properly* integrate from [here](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_mgmt_soc_gf180mcu/blob/main/verilog/dv/firmware/APIs/firmware_apis.h) into the caravel_board flow).
    *   Replace the `stub.c` include to `stub.h` (because `Makefile` already includes `stub.c`).
    *   Replace:
        *   "`reg_la0`..." => "`reg_la2`..."
        *   "`reg_la1`..." => "`reg_la3`..."
        *   Why? See [reg_la1_data_in weirdness](#reg_la1_data_in-weirdness) below, if you care.
    *   Add in a blink loop at the end, based on the example above.
    *   Note that this mux_test.c firmware will:
        *   Enable output for Caravel's `gpio` pin.
        *   Select design 13 (one of the basic output test patterns).
        *   Configure `GPIO[37:8]` to be bidirectional, thus allowing output control from the design.
        *   Then select design 14 (inverted output test patterns).
        *   Enter endless loop blinking the `gpio` pin.
*   Build/flash the firmware: `make flash`
*   Once this firmware runs and enters the blinking state, design 14 should be selected, which [is a simple test pattern](https://github.com/algofoogle/algofoogle-multi-caravel/blob/19251b1d9f929e2b2e8c169404437b8a2398560e/verilog/rtl/mux/top_design_mux.v#L454):
    *   Should be able to probe `IO[31:24]` and see `10101010` outputs, then on `IO[23:16]` see `01010101`.


## Other notes

*   The mux registers power up in a random state, which means the active project (the one controlling the IOs) is selected at random.
*   Additionally, its control lines (e.g. reset) might also be random.
*   Power-cycling is the only way to (hopefully) get different states on the registers, and they have a tendency to hold their state as they discharge, and otherwise tend to lean more to a given state at power-on (so it's not completely random; there are biases).
*   All designs have the same clock source (`wb_clk_i`). They can be reset through a variety of means.
*   Across various power-cycles, I was sometimes getting:
    *   Various GPIOs being stuck high or low
    *   IO28 oscillating at 2.5MHz -- I later worked out this was Diego's `addr[0]` pin. Sometimes it wouldn't work: GPIO[6] is Diego's reset, and this was floating.
    *   It looked like some pins were behaving as inputs (i.e. they could pick up noise, so seemingly weren't being driven)
    *   These were all clues that the mux might be working, as well as the designs, but that I was controlling it incorrectly.
    *   I got lucky when it seemed to start up one time with [design 11](https://github.com/algofoogle/algofoogle-multi-caravel/blob/19251b1d9f929e2b2e8c169404437b8a2398560e/verilog/rtl/mux/top_design_mux.v#L394) because this allows for some basic debug.

## `reg_la1_data_in` weirdness

> [!NOTE]
>
> This section is a lot more information than you want, so here's a **TL;DR**:
> * **In sky130 projects**, if you want your firmware to assert something on the LA bank 0 pins (`la_data_in[31:0]`), write to the `reg_la0_data` register. If you want it to sense something on the corresponding LA bank 0 pins (`la_data_out[31:0]`), read from the `reg_la0_data_in` register. `reg_la1_*` is the next bank up.
> * **In GFMPW projects**, if you want your firmware to assert something on the LA bank 0 pins (`la_data_in[31:0]`), write to **the `reg_la2_data` register**. If you want it to sense something on the corresponding LA bank 0 pins (`la_data_out[31:0]`), read from **the `reg_la2_data_in` register**. **`reg_la3_*`** is the next bank up. Don't use `reg_la1/0_*` -- they exist but don't do what you want.

The above is all you really need to know to make working firmware that controls the mux. If you care about all the details, though, you can read on...

For the Caravel CPU to assert something on an LA pin (i.e. `la_data_in[*]`), it must write to one of the `reg_la*_data` registers. To sense an LA pin (i.e. `la_data_out[*]`) it must read from one of the `reg_la*_data_in` registers. [This was unclear](https://web.open-source-silicon.dev/t/22781557/i-expect-that-is-just-a-holdover-from-some-earlier-version-o) because there is still [evidence of this in the 'caravel' repo](https://github.com/efabless/caravel/blob/49c5a688b1e8142c9790008069cca352e30992f9/verilog/dv/caravel/defs.h#L47-L61) but it doesn't work this way anymore.

**Additionally for GFMPW, though**, while the registers (namely their addresses in firmware headers) are correctly defined for sky130, they are **not** for gf180. In particular, if you have firmware for a GFMPW chip that accesses `reg_la3_*`/`reg_la2_*` (which GFMPW shouldn't have, since it only has 64 LA channels instead of 128, thus it lacks LA banks 3 and 2), it will actually be accessing the registers of LA banks 1 and 0 respectively (*as though you were* accessing `reg_la1_*`/`reg_la0_*`). If you try actually using `reg_la0_data`, it will be wrong: it will be accessing a register that is off by +8. This is a quirk of the generic `defs.h` pattern and the way the LA bank registers are reverse-numbered (I guess big-endian).

Evidently, this is an oddity that's known and accepted by the GFMPW version of the "firmware APIs", [where `reg_la3/2_*` are used intentionally](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_mgmt_soc_gf180mcu/blob/0f3bc96eabbde0a2b6c2bef479edd04d44c5b8e9/verilog/dv/firmware/APIs/la.h#L85-L86).

So, to compensate for this on GFMPW, either use the `LogicAnalyzer_*` functions (e.g. `LogicAnalyzer_write`), or use `reg_la3/2_*` directly, or create some abstraction of your own.

Additional evidence:
*   I've got a sky130 caravel_user_project counter demo chip ([CI2304-E3](https://github.com/jeffdi/mpw-9-test)), where the `_data_in` version means "into the CPU from mprj", while `_data` means "out from CPU, into mprj".
    *   I can [confirm](https://github.com/jeffdi/mpw-9-test/blob/4893a312064b64a2e9ba6a0adbb51f7b8c12cbb2/verilog/dv/la_test1/la_test1.c#L121) this successfully uses `_data_in` for the CPU to read from mprj.
    *   [Matt's notes](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_board/tree/main/firmware/chipignite/demos#logic-analyser-notes) and [demos.c](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_board/blob/5b44f382b1276531095d4cdf9c8bc0e7a19183f8/firmware/chipignite/demos/demos.c#L190-L194) seem to back this up also.
    *   `_data_in` regs are [defined in caravel_mgmt_soc_litex](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_mgmt_soc_litex/blob/503eda0790085712ffef7f4ad8934c7daed3237f/verilog/dv/firmware/defs.h#L71-L74) => [CSR_LA_IN_ADDR](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_mgmt_soc_litex/blob/503eda0790085712ffef7f4ad8934c7daed3237f/verilog/dv/generated/csr.h#L282)
*   I first picked up on this GFMPW discrepancy when I was compiling via caravel_board's `firmware/gf180`: it appeared that `_data_in` was the reverse, i.e. "out from CPU, into mprj". Certainly my mux control worked when I treated it this way (i.e. writing to `reg_la0_data_in` instead of `reg_la0_data`), and didn't work otherwise, and I speculated that this apparent reversal was due to a misalignment of register addresses, as a result of GFMPW's Caravel having only two LA banks instead of four.

The problem is that the register address ranges are different, but `defs.h` assumes always 4 banks of LA registers, and so its arithmetic is off and by a quirk of how they're reverse-numbered, `reg_la0_*` and `reg_la1_*` of each "set" ends up referring to the correct banks but of the NEXT set down, e.g.:
*   `reg_la0_iena` should refer to LA_IEN[31:0], but on GF180 instead refers to **LA_OE**[31:0].
*   `reg_la0_oenb` should refer to LA_OE[31:0], but on GF180 instead refers to **LA_IN**[31:0].
*   `reg_la0_data_in` should be LA_IN[31:0], but on GF180 instead refers to **LA_OUT**[31:0].
*   `reg_la0_data` should be LA_OUT[31:0], but on GF180 is invalid.
*   `reg_la3_iena` should be absent from GF180, but it refers to **LA_IEN**[63:32].

Here's a table where I try to illustrate this:
