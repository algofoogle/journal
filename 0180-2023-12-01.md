# GFMPW-1 raybox-zero hardening

*   Added `raybox-zero/test` -- VERY basic Verilog TBs for now.
*   Changed rcp (reciprocal) implementation to go via a simple FSM wrapper. This has improved the timing enough to get a successful harden at a clock period of 44ns (~22.72MHz). We can probably go further by fixing up the shmul (shared multiplier) too.
