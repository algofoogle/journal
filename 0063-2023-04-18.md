# More Raybox ideas

*   [Division in Verilog](https://projectf.io/posts/division-in-verilog/) - Expect [Q8.8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(number_format)) division to take 24 cycles.
    *   Start with a simple (even naive) divider, to prove we can get things to work, then see if we can optimise later...
    *   Iterative division and multiplication could be short-circuited for dividends with leading zeros?
    *   Is there a fast reciprocal we can use, even if approximated?

    *   Also look for optimisations that involve known short-cuts.
    *   Is there a successive-approximation we could use with a LUT?
*   If we use a local memory (i.e. buffer trace data inside the design instead of external RAM) then we get a few benefits:
    *   Faster
    *   Can be any topology we like, hence maybe simpler for our design's specific needs
    *   Fewer external parts (and IO) required
*   A local memory could be regular RAM (e.g. OpenRAM), DFF array, or maybe best: We could use a FIFO memory for this design, since individual addressing is not needed and already-used values can be discarded.
*   If we use an external memory, this can still work. We just need to make sure:
    *   We store and retrieve enough bits in parallel for all of the different types of data we need (e.g. height/distance, texture, texel, side).
    *   We separate reads (visible area) from writes (processing time during VBLANK).
    *   Access is fast enough. Writing is not so bad, but assuming full 640x resolution, we need to read on every clock at 25MHz, i.e. 40ns.
*   Is fixed-point or floating-point actually better for our hardware?

# Other notes

*   In SystemVerilog:
    *   What is `logic` and `wire logic` vs. just `wire`?
    *   `always_comb` can (must) do direct assignment (`=`), vs. `always_ff` requires (`<=`).
