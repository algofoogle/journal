# Improvements for Pico-DE0 adapter board

When made as a proper PCB:
*   Two-way jumpers, one option going direct, other via current-limiting (safety) resistor.

    What's the max sink/source of both DE0 and Pico?
    *   [Cyclone IV data](https://docs.rs-online.com/cc67/0900766b814d52bb.pdf#page=2&zoom=100,216,352) suggests
        max pin current of 25mA. Suggest we assume 20mA.
    *   [Discussion here on RP2040](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=300735#p1806362) suggests
        max pin current of 12mA. Suggest we assume 10mA.

    Thus, safety resistor on 3.3V short should be 330&ohm;
*   Header pins *and* header sockets.
*   Markers (silkscreen?) for danger pins.
*   T-shape?
*   Pico stand-off and swappability. Use 10-way stacking headers for DIP-IC-style pin profiles? DIP socket stripes.
*   Cuttable traces
*   Break-off strips that can be used to couple a breadboard into the adapter?

# Implementation

So far this is very rough and ready, and I've
[started implementing it in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/367485443004483585)
as a clumsy state machine using the RP2040 C SDK. The way I've done it should be very lightweight,
and hopefully reliable, but probably hard to read/follow. Also need to work out later how
we want to handle out-of-band stuff like reacting to whatever we consider an "interrupt".

1.  Start up with all GPIOs (except USB) set to input.
2.  Blink LED 3 times.
3.  Line-based comms? Even when doing binary payloads.
4.  Lines starting with `#` are ignored; a way to do debug output.
5.  Is ENTER key in minicom always just 0x0A (LF)? What about in PuTTY, etc?
6.  `@` means "read all GPIOs" and returns state of GPIO[29:0] as a binary string (1s and 0s).
7.  `e` means "echo" and 
8.  Good responses start with `>`, bad responses start with `!`, and 

# Notes

*   Experimenting with [Pi Pico in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/367485443004483585).
*   Maybe [IRQ stuff in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/360219175603757057)?
*   [Wokwi example with Verilog](https://wokwi.com/projects/347074912469385810)
*   [Wokwi Pico Assembly example](https://wokwi.com/projects/360134945820730369)
*   Other useful Pico-DE0 feature ideas:
    *   Set/Clear/Toggle an individual GPIO.
    *   ...or a range...
    *   ...optionally while changing direction of others, e.g. for bi-dir.
    *   Pulse option.
    *   One-shot or looping pattern playout.
    *   Set interrupt handler.
    *   NOTE: Some of these things might be more like PIO behaviour.
*   RP2040 is documented as having 30 GPIOs, or maybe 32 (GPIO0..31?), but BOOTSEL (input only?)
    is [documented to be GPIO33?](https://gist.github.com/jepler/c7676f0c5fe4eab9c584424d997a7991)?
*   Pico USB serial selection happens inside `CMakeLists.txt`:
    ```cmake
    # Enable usb output:
    pico_enable_stdio_usb(${PROJECT_NAME} 1)
    # Disable uart output:
    pico_enable_stdio_uart(${PROJECT_NAME} 0)
    ```
    ...I assume therefore that any printf or read stuff is ubiquitous and just follows whichever device is selected.

*   Can we do both USB output *and* debug output via a 2nd UART or SWD?
