Want to try driving/reading DE0-Nano pins with async clocking, so as to behave like an actual CPU bus:

*   Consider making the DUT (target design) interface just 8 IOs, so it is both simpler to implement (I think?)
    and works with more controllers that are IO-constrained, e.g. have up to 4 control pins, and a bi-dir nibble
    (so a 24-bit register would take 6 control-clocks). Just remember that the speed of reads/writes would be
    slower than the main system clock, because of the synchronising input DFFs (i.e. metastability avoidance).
*   USB-UART options:
    *   Most USB-UARTs seem to max out around 1~2Mbps.
    *   I think FTDI chips (FT232) have 8 GPIOs, controllable by USB, besides just their UART.

        ([datasheet](https://rocelec.widen.net/view/pdf/lbnf5iposc/CYPR-S-A0004572493-1.pdf?t.download=true&u=5oefqw)) is a pin-compatible replacement for FTDI chip?
        Besides 2-pin up to 8-bit UART, it also has 8 GPIOs. In turn these could probably cooperate with a shift register or IO expander?
    *   [FT232H](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2264) (see also: [datasheet](https://ftdichip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DS_FT232H.pdf))
        can do a bunch of other generic serial protocols, but still only 8 GPIO?
        [This](https://hamvoip.org/hamradio/USBtoGPIO/) claims:
        >   The board supports a total of 16 I/O lines in any combination of input or output. All lines are 3v or 5V capable.
        ...but is that definitely true? I didn't *fully* get that impression from the datasheet.
    *   FT245 by comparison is a USB 8-bit IO with FIFO but reads/writes are driven by an external master.
    *   CH340G and CP2102 I don't think are suitable: There are flow control pins but not sure if
        we can use them as IOs; certainly there are not enough.
    *   [CH341 (maybe CH341A?)](https://www.anok.ceti.pl/download/ch341ds1.pdf) (see also: [here](http://www.wch-ic.com/products/CH341.html))
        looks like it can be a USB-UART,
        but also USB parallel port and [EPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1284#IEEE_1284_modes) (supposedly
        the EPP standard can do up to 2MByte/sec, half-duplex bi-dir, but not sure what CH341A actually maxes at),
        including 8 data pins and other parallel port control pins...?
        Supports [IEEE-1284](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1284).
        The CH341A "MEM" mode sort of looks like a wider general bus/GPIO mode, but it's not clear.
        Table 4.5 of the datasheet ("Parallel mode pins") shows that there are 8 bi-dir tri-state IOs,
        3 dedicated outputs (though one may be a reset line only?)
        1 tri-state output, 4 dedicated inputs (including 1 interrupt?), and a CH341A WAIT input.
    *   [MCP2210](https://au.mouser.com/datasheet/2/268/MCP2210_USB_to_SPI_Protocol_Converter_with_GPIO__H-2585460.pdf)
        has 8 pins that can be used as GPIOs, and 1 extra input-only.
*   Could use an STM32 with firmware doing just the main intended tests, or it could be a bridge.
    *   If STM32 blue pill can do UART over USB (to host PC), or even be a custom USB device,
        then this is probably fine: program it with firmware that understands how to receive "commands"
        over UART and 
*   Look into "[Firmata protocol](https://github.com/firmata/protocol)" for converting Arduino boards into USB-GPIOs?
    See [general description of firmata/arduino](https://github.com/firmata/arduino). Note that "StandardFirmata"
    might be the way to go?
