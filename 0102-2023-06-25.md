# Raybox-bridge: What language?

## Python on Windows

*   I tried using Python 3.11.4 with Pygame, and even before I got into trying to send data to
    the Pico-DE0, it was starting to look like Python would be just too slow.
*   However, I might've created problems for myself by:
    1.  Using `time.monotonic_ns()`; it seems `time.perf_counter_ns()` might be better for my needs.
    2.  Running this from within VSCode.
*   For whatever reason, VSCode slows it down, maybe because of the Integrated Terminal's performance.
*   I found that tweaking a bit and running from a Windows Terminal met the target performance.
    The outer loop goes thru an average of ~3500 iterations per "tick" (where I've defined a
    tick to be 5ms), where it basically just tests for reaching/exceeding a tick's worth of time
    and checks for Pygame events. Output of
    [the current code](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/3e95d2f44b7e3c2f70fe156271e9d89ca7201b18/pi_pico/pico-de0/client/raybox-bridge.py)
    looks something like this on my i7-7700:

    ```
    Each "hit" is where it would get to send data within the desired "tick" window, i.e.
    it hits its scheduling.
*   I ran this same code for 100,000 iterations (500 seconds) and it missed the window 12 times
    (0.012%).

## Alternatives

*   I can already do SDL on Windows, so C++ is an option. This should reduce all processing overheads
    to a minimum, which means it would basically just be the USB-CDC overhead and response time
    of the Pi Pico (Pico-DE0 board).
*   In any case, I think I need to make firmware for the Pico-DE0 that is optimised for this job,
    so we only need to send one command with all the necessary register parameters and let the
    Pico-DE0 send it to the FPGA design as fast as it can.
*   PIO is another option; offload the job.
*   [Cython](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3250299/what-is-cython-python-at-the-speed-of-c.html
    and [Codon](https://thenewstack.io/mit-created-compiler-speeds-up-python-code/) could be
    interesting to look into for compiling Python code.

# Notes

*   [Got basic cursor tracking working in raybox-bridge](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/89b85db438dd36d54ff1b3c0dff24d64d7938788/pi_pico/pico-de0/client/raybox-bridge.py)
*   I also [updated it to prove USB comms could work](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/583c76e23814861f6aaf545520bf4eae8ada7855/pi_pico/pico-de0/client/raybox-bridge.py)
    though for now it's just streaming the data as dummy "echo" commands.
*   Got my PR merged for TT04 GHA's:
    https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt-gds-action/pull/1

# Next steps

*   Try a really simple VGA/cursor/GPIO experiment:
    Make a VGA design that just renders a cursor (even just a rectangle) on-screen at a given X/Y
    position, and make that position come from momentary GPIO states... intentionally doing it in
    a way that could experience race conditions (i.e. not registered).
    Then work out which actual GPIOs to map bits to on the Pico, perhaps providing an abstraction
    function. Hopefully this should reveal things like tearing when moving the mouse really fast.
*   This will probably only need 19 bits (X is 10, Y is 9), and we have maybe up to 26 bits total,
    so we could use the extra 7 bits for some mouse button and keyboard states and mousewheel
    mapping to cursor colour.
*   Then try to work on building an actual firmware command to accept a full state transfer, which
    the Pico will then clock out to an update to the VGA design that is *registered* and possibly
    even has a buffer. That could also be triggered by an IRQ from the design back to the Pico?
*   Finally start trying to work that into the Raybox design.
