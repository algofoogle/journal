# Let's get started with TT04

Before making a more serious design, let's see if I can make any design at all.

I'll go thru [this TT04 intro video][TT04 vid]. Also need to check out [this TT04 HDL video][TT04 HDL].

I'll create my repo(s) by cloning rather than forking (since only 1 for is allowed, and I want to probably
do many).

1.  Go to template repo: https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt04-submission-template
2.  Per [instructions for making a new repo without forking][new repo]...
3.  Log in to GitHub, then go to the [import URL][GitHub import].
4.  Paste in the TT04 template URL: https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt04-submission-template
5.  Call it `tt04-solo-squash`
6.  Go to the new repo: https://github.com/algofoogle/tt04-solo-squash
7.  Go to the repo's [Action settings][], select "Allow all actions and reusable workflows", and click "Save".
8.  Go to the repo's [Pages settings][], set "Source" to "GitHub Actions".
9.  Verify the Actions are now accessible in the [Actions tab][].
10. Go to [info.yaml][] and hit `.` to go to the integrated code editor (git.dev). Borrow details from [tt03p5-solo-squash][].
    I changed the top module name to `tt_um_algofoogle_tt04_solo_squash`.
11. After editing the file, we need to commit. Click the "branch" icon from the LHS toolbar,
    enter a commit message, and click "Commit &amp; Push".
    The Actions will start but fail (since there's no source yet).
12. Click the hamburger menu and select "Go to repository"
13. Clone the repo for local dev.
14. Copy all the main files from tt03p5-solo-squash into this tt04-solo-squash repo.
    I just did this the easy way with Windows File Explorer for the following stuff:
    *   `doc/`
    *   `src/` (excluding existing TT04 template files `cells.v` and `config.tcl`)
15. git add everything and [commit](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt04-solo-squash/commit/91a11c6cd7b0e48809fdf1a87c06ae3e018b8b4d).


# Notes

*   I had previously tried using git submodules to put the source into `src/solo_squash`
    (as evidenced by [`.gitmodules`](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt03p5-solo-squash/blob/main/.gitmodules))
    but I ended up abandoning this at the time because the workflows didn't support it fully.
    This has evidently been fixed now so I could try it again, though might need to make sure
    I check for differences between the implementations of solo_squash.
*   Do we need to worry about doing an update from the TT04 template in future? i.e. a git pull/merge?
*   Should I keep solo_squash in TT04 just the same as TT03p5? That way we could compare.
*   Don't forget to share to social media with `#tinytapeout` hashtag and link [@matthewvenn][]
