## More Verilator

Loosely following [this tutorial](https://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html), I did the following, in [`t01b`]...

I created [`counter.v`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/7d13f7cad822e7eb1ad8ab1ae9ef001fd13516b8/fpga/verilator/test01/t01b/counter.v#L1) which includes a `$display` statement and `$finish` condition. Probably not necessary to do it this way (i.e. testing-related stuff should probably not be in the module under test), but I'm just learning for now and this will do. Later we'll try `printf` statements in the C++ code.

I made a [`TESTBENCH` template header file](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/7d13f7cad822e7eb1ad8ab1ae9ef001fd13516b8/fpga/verilator/test01/t01b/testbench.h#L4) by copying the example. I fixed it to declare everything `public` and updated it to use my signal names of `clk` and `reset`.

I created [`sim_main.cpp`](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/7d13f7cad822e7eb1ad8ab1ae9ef001fd13516b8/fpga/verilator/test01/t01b/sim_main.cpp#L7-L11) which is just a simple endless clocking testbench.

Compiled it and ran it all with:
```bash
verilator -Wall --cc counter.v --exe --build sim_main.cpp && obj_dir/Vcounter
```

Running it works as expected. Note that it definitely seems to start with all register values at 0 (hence count starting at 0, and not getting up to 255):

```
Counted   0
Counted 100
- counter.v:10: Verilog $finish
```

Actually, with respect to initial values, I learned that the `verilator` command has a default [`--x-initial unique` switch](https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator/Manual-verilator#x-initial-unique-default) which defines that it should determine the value of otherwise unset registers/inputs using a "unique" function (i.e. dynamically-generated). That function in turn is controlled by a command-line switch to the actual executable test bench (`obj_dir/Vcounter` in this case) called [`+verilator+rand+reset+`*value*](https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator/Manual-verilator#verilator-rand-reset-value).

It looks like this reset value:
*   Defaults to `0`;
*   Can be set to `1` to set all bits;
*   Can be set to `2` to randomise all bits.

For example, this command will start with all unassigned values being set to 0:

```
obj_dir/Vcounter
```

...while this will start with them all set to 1:

```
obj_dir/Vcounter +verilator+rand+reset+1
```

This causes the testbench to run endlessly. It outputs:
```
Counted 255
Counted   0
Counted   0
Counted   0
...
```

This makes sense because:
*   The initial value of everything is set to 1, so the counter's initial value is `8'b11111111` (i.e. 255).
*   On the positive edge of `clk`, we know that `q` will *become* set to something other than 255, but that hasn't yet taken effect so the first `if` detects `q==255` and displays its value.
*   Once the `always` block ends, the assignment to `q` takes effect, but since `reset` is *also* asserted (given it uses positive logic, is unassigned, and our default state is `1`) then our counter gets reset.
*   For each subsequent iteration of the test bench, `reset` remains unassigned (hence `1`), thus the `always` block starts endlessly displaying `Counted 0`.

I [changed `sim_main.cpp` to add an initial reset](https://github.com/algofoogle/sandpit/blob/84870936d45b77b224aebfce032c947aae0e7a21/fpga/verilator/test01/t01b/sim_main.cpp#L9) (which includes an internal `tick` call inside the `reset` cycle to ensure it is synchronously clocked, properly). After rebuilding with `verilator`, I can now do this:

```
$ obj_dir/Vcounter +verilator+rand+reset+0
Counted   0
Counted   0
Counted 100
- counter.v:10: Verilog $finish

$ obj_dir/Vcounter +verilator+rand+reset+1
Counted 255
Counted   0
Counted 100
- counter.v:10: Verilog $finish

$ obj_dir/Vcounter +verilator+rand+reset+2
Counted   0
Counted 100
- counter.v:10: Verilog $finish
```

To explain:
*   Example `0` starts with `q` all 0, which matches the first `if` condition *during the `reset()` call*, hence displays `Counted 0`. It then starts the `tick()` loop which again displays `Counted 0`, counts up to display `Counted 100`, then hits `$finish` at `q==110`.
*   Example `1` starts with `q` all 1, doing the same as above but for the `255` condition.
*   Example `2` starts with `q` in a random state, but obviously not 0, 100, 110, or 255, so the very first `reset()` call doesn't lead to anything being displayed. It then starts the loop with `Counted 0`, and stops at `Counted 100`.

We could probably put a check for `reset==1` in the first `if` condition to *always* display what was loaded into `q` at the start.

NOTE: I believe there are command-line switches for setting the random seed value. Without this, it possibly picks the same random value(s) each time it is run.


## Other things learned

*   An example of a similar `TESTBENCH` template, which includes capturing signal traces as VCD: https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/sim/verilator/testb.h
*   Delays (`#nnn`) are ignored:
    ```
    %Warning-STMTDLY: counter.v:12:4: Unsupported: Ignoring delay on this delayed statement.
                                    : ... In instance counter
       12 |   #100;
          |    ^~~
                      ... Use "/* verilator lint_off STMTDLY */" and lint_on around source to disable this message.
    ```
*   [`$monitor` in Verilog](http://www.referencedesigner.com/tutorials/verilog/verilog_09.php) is a nifty way to report any time a parameter changes value, during simulation.
