# Improving GFMPW-1 muti-project mux and layout

*   Let's try a different mux layout: horizontal, in the middle. Expected advantages:
    *   BL corner can be reserved for JM to get close access to WB.
    *   TL can be for TRZF for close access to wb_clk_i, and direct `io_in`s
    *   The B edge of padframe is least important because it has no external IOs.
    *   Also R edge is of reduced interest because of SoC IO sharing. TRZF already avoids it, JM won't need it, DS can avoid most of it.
*   Try alternate clock for 2nd raybox-zero instance?    
*   Repeat wb_clk_i (and reset?) out for all designs.
*   Write steps for how to add a new design?
*   Optionally allow io[0] to be an external reset? Can this function be gated by the mux?
*   Work out ideal pin ordering for everyone's needs, inc. where some people can have direct inputs instead of via mux.
*   Intentionally route some signals very far (e.g. LA[63:0]) to see if they ACTUALLY have a problem/latency.
