# Getting algofoogle-multi-caravel up to efabless

## Issues to work out

*   When doing an OpenMPW submission, do you need to *embed* the source of everyone's designs? Given git submodules seem broken in the efabless git server, what can we do?
    *   Is there an official way to do it with submodules?
    *   Would submodules work if they were all hosted by efabless too?
    *   Must we just *copy* all the source directly into the repo from everyone's projects?
    *   What did Tholin do? Just copied in each, it seems.
    *   We must ensure everyone's designs can harden under the same CUP.
*   I want to work with a git submodule in my main repo, and then (assuming necessary) convert it to inline content (without a submodule) in CUP.
*   I want to try two different versions of raybox-zero and ensure they don't conflict (even though they will have some modules with the same names):
    *   There could be a `raybox-zero-common` dir, for things that don't change.
    *   Then we could have `raybox-zero-original` and `raybox-zero-retimed`.
    *   OR call them `raybox-zero-combo` and `raybox-zero-fsm`.
    *   Make sure that each variation 
    *   Can we cheat by just using `` `include `` statements all the way, and referencing relative paths?
*   Don't forget tests!
*   Need to create a mux.

I think I need to do the following, which is probably what the other people wanting to do a submission would also need to do:

1.  Create a combo repo called (maybe) `ztoa-team-multi-caravel`.
2.  Create my own separate CUPs with different instantiations of raybox-zero branches.
3.  Harden in those separate CUPs, and then transfer all related files manually (or via a script) into `ztoa-team-multi-caravel`.
4.  Be sure to note in the README (and even in subdirs) what the respective repos are.
5.  When the other repos are copied in to ztmc, prove that they still harden the same way.
6.  FOCUS: JUST GET IT WORKING FOR ONE RAYBOX-ZERO INSTANCE, FIRST, AND UP TO EFABLESS!
