# Getting algofoogle-multi-caravel up to efabless

## Issues to work out

*   When doing an OpenMPW submission, do you need to *embed* the source of everyone's designs? Given git submodules seem broken in the efabless git server, what can we do?
    *   Is there an official way to do it with submodules?
    *   Would submodules work if they were all hosted by efabless too?
    *   Must we just *copy* all the source directly into the repo from everyone's projects?
    *   What did Tholin do? Just copied in each, it seems.
    *   We must ensure everyone's designs can harden under the same CUP.
*   I want to work with a git submodule in my main repo, and then (assuming necessary) convert it to inline content (without a submodule) in CUP.
*   I want to try two different versions of raybox-zero and ensure they don't conflict (even though they will have some modules with the same names):
    *   There could be a `raybox-zero-common` dir, for things that don't change.
    *   Then we could have `raybox-zero-original` and `raybox-zero-retimed`.
    *   OR call them `raybox-zero-combo` and `raybox-zero-fsm`.
    *   Make sure that each variation 
    *   Can we cheat by just using `` `include `` statements all the way, and referencing relative paths?
*   Don't forget tests!
*   Need to create a mux. NOTE: If we use a tri-state solution (i.e. instead of a mux) then I think each design can just share a common bus, but we must make sure there are no buffers inserted on macro pins (i.e. a config.json requirement, as per TT also).
*   Reduce no. of LAs. Use more IOs.

I think I need to do the following, which is probably what the other people wanting to do a submission would also need to do:

1.  Create a combo repo called (maybe) `ztoa-team-multi-caravel`.
2.  Create my own separate CUPs with different instantiations of raybox-zero branches.
3.  Harden in those separate CUPs, and then transfer all related files manually (or via a script) into `ztoa-team-multi-caravel`.
4.  Be sure to note in the README (and even in subdirs) what the respective repos are.
5.  When the other repos are copied in to ztmc, prove that they still harden the same way.
6.  FOCUS: JUST GET IT WORKING FOR ONE RAYBOX-ZERO INSTANCE, FIRST, AND UP TO EFABLESS!
7.  VERIFY: Can ALL 38 GPIOs be used by a user design? My assumption that this is OK: At the right time, the firmware will just have to agree to disable all the other SoC functions that share GPIOs.

## Map

*   https://github.com/algofoogle/algofoogle-multi-caravel:
    *   Anton's collection of projects to *individually* harden and then combine into another repo to submit for GFMPW-1
    *   Intended branches:
        *   `gf180-base`: Clean setup from which other projects can stem. If its gets updated for any reason, hopefully we can merge from `gf180-base` to the respective other project branches (though hopefully we shouldn't need to).
        *   `gf180-rbz-combo`: `verilog/rtl/raybox-zero` is a submodule on a branch that implements a lower-speed (15MHz?) hardening solution for raybox-zero pretty much as it comes from sky130, maybe just with pin placement tweaked.
        *   `gf180-rbz-fsm`: `verilog/rtl/raybox-zero` is a submodule on a branch that uses the 'safer' parallel FSM modules, and is reported by OpenLane to achieve better timing (22.72MHz?)
        *   `gf180-ss`: solo_squash
        *   `gf180-vsr`: tt05-vga-spi-rom
*   https://repositories.efabless.com/algofoogle/ztoa-team-multi-caravel:
    *   Needs a mux block and proper wiring. This could be ugly: Even with 30 IOs, that's 90 *per project* (io_in, io_out, io_oeb for each)
    *   Copy all of the individual projects into this one and maintain on efabless.
    *   NO branches.
    *   Make sure all can be hardened within this repo, and combined into UPW.
    *   Create combined README, plus probably individual READMEs within subdirectories, with links to respective original repos.
    *   Must pass precheck.
    *   Make sure SPDX data is correct -- licenses throughout.
    *   Method for updating:
        *   Harden in source repo/branch to make sure it all works OK.
        *   Copy algofoogle-multi-caravel@gf180-rbz-fsm contents for `verilog/rtl/raybox-zero-fsm` -- remove `.git*` stuff if any.
        *   Make sure READMEs are updated and reference their respective source repo commits. This should include both the source CUP repo's commit, and whatever its project submodule commit is.
        *   Make sure all `verilog/rtl/raybox-zero-fsm/src/rtl/*.v` are up-to-date in `verilog/includes/*`
        *   NOTE: Decide where the top module should live for each macro. In its respective subdiretory of `verilog/rtl/...` is probably best.
        *   CHECK whether `user_defines` needs to be updated. Might not need to worry too much given mux.
        *   Update a snippet in `user_project_wrapper.v` -- make sure it is compatible with our mux.
        *   Copy in `openlane/PROJECTNAME`
        *   Update combo README.
        *   Update `lvs/user_project_wrapper/lvs_config.json` if needed.
        *   Update `openlane/user_project_wrapper` if needed.
        *   Do a test harden.

List of stuff I've done to `algofoogle-multi-caravel`:

*   Add to `.gitignore`:
    ```
    caravel
    dependencies
    JUNK
    mgmt_core_wrapper
    ```
*   Added raybox-zero@ew submodule (later @gf180?)
*   Created `openlane/top_ew_algofoogle/config.json`
*   Updated `openlane/user_project_wrapper/{config.json,macro.cfg}`
*   Updated `verilog/includes/*`
*   Updated `verilog/rtl/user_defines.v`
*   Updated `verilog/rtl/user_project_wrapper.v`
*   Added hardened files: def, lef, gds, lib, mag, maglef, sdc, sdf, signoff, spef, spi, verilog/gl
*   Updated README
*   Updated `lvs/user_project_wrapper/lvs_config.json`

Things to check:

*   All IO/port mappings are correct
*   Update README
*   Update `docs/`
*   Tests should be in place
*   Do full GL test inc. when we have mutliple designs muxed

## What I did

*   Cloned https://github.com/algofoogle/algofoogle-multi-caravel
*   `git checkout 3be3f7804e20d0785cae63dba2fe0d0c1ca57992`: Puts us at the "[Removed (most) example stuff](https://github.com/algofoogle/algofoogle-multi-caravel/commit/3be3f7804e20d0785cae63dba2fe0d0c1ca57992)" commit.
*   `git checkout -b gf180-base`: `gf180-base` branch is now a relatively clean base for making a new branch for each project.
*   `git push -u origin gf180-base`: Make sure `gf180-base` branch is on GitHub.
*   Made `gf180-base` the default branch in GitHub.
*   Updated README a bit to explain that this a base repo with multiple branches for each project.
*   Removed contents of `docs/` because it is a little outdated and belongs more to `user_proj_example`.
*   Disabled automatic running of GitHub Actions, and otherwise updated:
    *   Added submodule recursion to checkout, and changed checkout from v2 to v3.
    *   Changed `user_proj_example` to `REPLACEME_project_macro_name`
    *   Changed `user_project_flow_gf180mcuC` to `user_project_flow_gf180mcuD`
*   Set user_defines for GPIOs 5..7 just to reflect their default SoC functions. Note that this means GPIO 6 will always power up as an OUTPUT, so beware.
*   Put `REPLACEME_...` markers all over the place.
    *   `REPLACEME_project_macro_name`: Replaces user_proj_example; should be the name of your top module, macro, instance, etc.
    *   `REPLACEME_all_other_rtl_source_files`: Expand to a list of each of the .v files that make up the RTL source of your project
    *   `REPLACEME_clock_port`: Appears in UPW's `config.json`. The `CLOCK_PORT` to use, which ***I think*** is typically the name of the macro's top port at which the clock signal comes in.
    *   REPLACEME_project_macro_name.`REPLACEME_clock_net`: I think this is the name of the net (inside the design) that will actually be used for doing CTS...? I suppose in this way we MIGHT be able to do clock gating, muxing, etc...? There [is confusion about this](https://vlsi.jp/Introduction_to_OpenMPW.html#:~:text=The%20CLOCK_PORT%20specifies%20the%20port%20used%20for%20the%20clock%20input%20of%20the%20design%2C%20and%20the%20CLOCK_NET%20I%20honestly%20don%E2%80%99t%20know).
*   Hopefully the only `user_proj_example` stuff that's left now is in `openlane/EXAMPLE-user_proj_example`

Still to do:

*   user_defines: Decide what their default configuration should be if we have multiple projects and a mux. Probably all INPUT_NOPULL to be safe?
