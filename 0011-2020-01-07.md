Starting to look into Geeetech A10 adhesion issues, I'm reading this: http://www.geeetech.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=61521 - and this: https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/9rx0zi/first_layer_problems_on_my_new_geeetech_a10/

Suggestions include:

*   Use a better filament (e.g. Prusament?)
*   70&deg;C for bed, 210&deg;C for end.
*   12mm speed for first layer.
*   Be careful about scratching the bed.
*   Check the bed is not warped. Try 9-point levelling? Is that "mesh leveling"?
*   Use isopropyl alcohol to clean the bed.
*   [Try the calibration cube](http://www.geeetech.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=85632&sid=d6847a1ce0239590122ecc2616fb3a2d#p85632) with the A10 Cura profile.
*   Try another [test object](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2656594).
*   Check if there is a problem with under-extrusion. [Extra pressure on the filament lever](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/9rx0zi/first_layer_problems_on_my_new_geeetech_a10/e8ldh6w/), maybe?
*   Replace nozzle?
