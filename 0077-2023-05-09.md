# Raybox

## Accomplishments

*   Got the sim building on Windows. Involves a little mucking around.
    *   The actual Windows setup of `make` and the GCC build environment (using MinGW)
is documented in the [Raybox README][].
*   Got mouse rotation working (in Windows only; Linux might be having a pointer problem due to VirtualBox virtual pointer), and in combination with WASD it feels a bit more like a real FPS now!
*   Started working on code that will lead to wall textures.

## Stuff I would expect to sort out before calling this Version 1

In order of priority, I think:

*   Build for Caravel
*   Loading a map. Can't really have a game without it.
*   Sprites -- could include screen overlays/artwork
*   Textures
*   Full screen width and FOV fix
*   Doors
*   Different wall IDs
*   Collisions, but this is possibly for the host controller to worry about
*   Testing the FPGA with an external host controller
    (e.g. Arduino, maybe needs to be STM32, ESP8266, or ESP32 for 3.3V?)

## Stuff I'd LIKE to do

*   Use an Arduino to interface with a keyboard and mouse (perhaps just PS/2 for now) and
    use the Arduino to try driving the FPGA; test direct vectors control in hardware, inc.
    crossing clock domains.
*   Build a VGA DAC, at least 3-3-3 bit depth.
*   Clean up FSM.

## Notes

*   Sim runs slowly on Windows compared to in a Linux VM on the same host. I'm guessing it's to do either with SDL2 or Verilator under Windows.
*   I haven't figured out how to get debugging working for the sim in VSCode yet. Supposedly fairly easy to do, but the VSCode Makefile extension is not compaatible with how my Makefile builds its launch target.
*   Notes on directly specifying launch target: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-makefile-tools/issues/198#issuecomment-1045170886 -- but I don't think it works for me. I don't get a local `.vscode/settings.json` with this repo.
