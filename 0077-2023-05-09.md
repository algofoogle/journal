## Accomplishments

*   Got the sim building on Windows. Involves a little mucking around.
*   Got mouse rotation working (in Windows only; Linux might be having a pointer problem due to VirtualBox virtual pointer), and in combination with WASD it feels a bit more like a real FPS now!

## Notes

*   Sim runs slowly on Windows compared to in a Linux VM on the same host. I'm guessing it's to do either with SDL2 or Verilator under Windows.
*   I haven't figured out how to get debugging working for the sim in VSCode yet. Supposedly fairly easy to do, but the VSCode Makefile extension is not compaatible with how my Makefile builds its launch target.
*   Notes on directly specifying launch target: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-makefile-tools/issues/198#issuecomment-1045170886 -- but I don't think it works for me. I don't get a local `.vscode/settings.json` with this repo.
