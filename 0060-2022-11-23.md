# 23 Nov 2022

Stuff to remember and try doing soon:

*   Put an index in [`README`](./README.md).
*   Try Jupyter again, or the Google Code thing.
*   **DONE:** Fix up `sandpit` repo, e.g. Connectorama and other uncommitted things.
*   Create helpers so that I can (say) link to my GitHub repos more easily in these notes.
*   Script to generate new journal entries.
*   Verilator. See [0050](./0050-2020-08-03.md) and beyond.
*   [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/).
*   RP2040. Simulation using [rp2040js](https://github.com/wokwi/rp2040js) ([example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/rp2040js-blink?file=index.ts)).
*   Compare laptop `sandpit` repo with that on desktop PC, esp. re KiCAD projects.
*   PLL in [Verilog](https://zipcpu.com/dsp/2017/12/14/logic-pll.html) and [C simulation](https://liquidsdr.org/blog/pll-howto/).
*   Diagrams (e.g. cabling) for IBM PS/1 FDD video. Why is pin 1 cut?
*   KiCad/PCB things to look into:
    *   How to include Edge Cuts in a footprint, or otherwise respect them when the footprint is placed.
    *   Purpose of layers:
        ```
        Edge.Cuts
        Margin
        F.Courtyard
        F.Fab
        ```
    *   Footprint libraries: MountingEquipment, MountingHole
    *   YouTube video on different PCB experiments:
        *   Chip-in-hole mount
        *   Test point holes (single and pair bridges) for clip probes
        *   QFN soldering esp. centre heatsink pad -- try cut-out instead, for direct soldering?
        *   Is it possible to make a PCB with holes that allow for vertical mounting of a VGA connector that uses *solder cups*? Or is the clearance too fine?
        *   DSUB-37 x 2 as general array - breakout
        *   Learn more about proper ways to do screw holes esp. for JLC.
        *   PCB inductors and capacitors.
        *   Vertical interfaces
        *   Angular mounting
        *   Mechanical interlocks -- puzzle edges or dovetails
        *   Silkscreen and other feature size tests
    *   JLC PCB assembly service via LCSC

Random notes:

*   Diodes/LEDs:
    *   *Typical* diode breakdown voltage: -50V to -100V.
    *   Typical (silicon) diode forward voltage: 0.7V.
    *   LED forward voltages usually in the range 1.6~3.3V (lowest for red, often around 1.8V).
*   Python:
    *   My VM has python3 installed, but not python (v2).
    *   PIP is not installed, so: `sudo apt install python3-pip` -- Reboot after this because of kernel update message.
*   Renaming KiCad projects:
    *   There are scripts to do this; I've seen a python2 stand-alone vs. python3 pip.
    *   With my "Connectorama" project in KiCad 6, is it just a simple matter of find-and-replace for all filenames and file contents that refer to Connectorama?
        *   I did this manually and it seemed to work OK.

## IBM PS/1 FDD adapter

First version works fine. Possible improvements:
*   Make it much smaller.
*   Option for vertical mounting rather than horizontal.
*   Do we need the holes or not?
*   Berg connector wire holes on other side
*   Fatter traces
*   Rounded/"melted" traces
*   Power LED for 5V and 12V
*   Look at other people's interpretations, esp. re pin 4
*   Board that can just do direct pass-thru but with Pin 4 override

## Connectorama/ACUcard next steps

Project has been renamed manually from 'Connectorama' to 'ACUcard'.

Next:

*   Do tests with existing prototype boards
*   Fix netclasses and do denser/neater packing of traces
*   Copper fills
*   Power breakout connector or edge fingers
*   Try 4-layer?
*   Remove /FAULT routing
*   Decoupling caps
*   Onboard test logic or prototyping area
*   Power LEDs
*   Better +36V switching supply -- try TI SMPS designer parts
*   Better board shape to fit better in PS/1
*   Actual useful card that plugs directly into ACU slot, e.g. see [this](https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=59348)
*   Fan-out PCB (backpane-style 2-part) rather than vertical PCB
