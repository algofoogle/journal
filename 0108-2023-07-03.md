# Quick vga_cursor notes

*   Fixed bug to reset `spi_done`.
*   PicoDeo firmware now supports sending cursor position using SPI (via bit-banging).
*   Cursor now stays square, as we expect, though there is a glitch where a column gets momentarily
    filled, that I think is actually just a problem with the "cursor Y stop" not being triggered
    because the cursor position gets updated (at VBLANK start) before it would have a chance.
    It seems like the proper thing to do here anyway is to make sure there is no logic that depends
    on comparisons being done in VBLANK, and in this case just resetting the register regardless as soon
    as VBLANK starts.
*   Now that we've got bit-banging of SPI working from PicoDeo, try using the RP2040's actual SPI hardware?
    Would be good to try speeding it up progressively.
*   Also try to now make raybox-bridge send the cursor using this new method (instead of just circle-cursor).
*   For Raybox, design could be simpler if we just let the host controller write into our registers
    directly when it is safe to do so (i.e. during visible region), and reject it otherwise.
