*   [Sample programs for Digispark](code/0002-digispark).
*   Arduino programs are called "Sketches", have file extension `.ino`, are recognised as C++ but typically don't need most headers, use `setup()` and `loop()` instead of `main()`, and must be placed in a folder that is the name of the Sketch in order for the Arduino IDE to accept them -- it asks to do this step for you, if necessary.
*   Arduino 1.8.5 can't build AVR code on macOS 10.15: It's a 32-bit executable, and [macOS 10.15 now only runs 64-bit](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/issues/8974).
*   Downloaded Arduino 1.8.10 IDE for macOS from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software).
    Extracting gives `Arduino.app`, which I copied to `/Applications`. Launching is annoying, as macOS reports:
    
    > “Arduino” can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.
    >
    > This software needs to be updated. Contact the developer for more information.
    >
    > Chrome downloaded this file today at 2:33 pm from www.arduino.cc.

    After this: Apple menu => `System Preferences...` => `Security &amp; Privacy` => `General`, then:

    > "Arduino" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.

    Click `Open Anyway`. It still reports the error, but at least it launches now.
*   There's more... the Digispark version of `avr-gcc` is still too old. [There are two possible solutions here](https://digistump.com/board/index.php?topic=3198.0). I used the [2nd](https://digistump.com/board/index.php/topic,3198.msg14487.html#msg14487).
*   Verifying (compiling) [01-blinky] yields:

    ```
    Sketch uses 712 bytes (11%) of program storage space. Maximum is 6012 bytes.
    Global variables use 9 bytes of dynamic memory.
    ```
