# Notes during TT04 final submission

## Admin

*   **DONE:** Wait for [GDS to build](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt04-raybox-zero/actions/runs/6117171037/job/16603410577)
*   **DONE:** When successful, record how long it took:
    *   It took about 36 minutes in total (i.e. I pushed it 36 minutes ago and it just finished all GHAs).
*   **DONE:** [buy initial submission](https://app.tinytapeout.com/projects/create)
    *   After the purchase, it seems it gives a *balance* of 8 tiles that I then use (again?) to '[Submit Project]' (#136).
*   **DONE:** Tag tt04-raybox-zero as 0.3:
    ```bash
    git tag -m "Use raybox-zero 0.3 with basic generated textures in TT04 4x2 tiles" -a 0.3
    git push
    git push --tags
    ``````
*   **DONE:** Build GDS locally (or download logs from GHA) to check for:
    *   GDS_logs from GHA is 742MB (compressed to ~100MB)
    *   Util: 43.25% - Wires: ~181mm - Cells: 6621
    *   Timing results - No setup, hold, slew, or cap violations.
    *   Linter warnings - Nothing to worry about
    *   Fanout: `Warning: : There are max fanout violations in the design at the typical corner. Please refer to '../work/runs/wokwi/reports/signoff/31-rcx_sta.checks.rpt'.`
        *   Fanout violations are all in clock tree. 25 in total. Worst 10:
            ```
            Pin                                   Limit Fanout  Slack

            ```
    *   Antennas
        *   Worst antenna violator out of 3 is 768.67:400.00; other 2 are 455:400 or less.
        *   Maybe if we fiddle with 
*   Get Matt or Uri to help with pushing thru the submission via [Submit Project].

## Last chance -- 3:30am

*   spi_device: Because I'm adding it so late, should it have its own interface, so it doesn't conflict with POV?
*   Need to put in a reset for `pov.spi_done`??
*   **There's a risk** that without `top.v` being tested, I can't be sure I haven't made a silly mistake.
*   Try Q11.11
*   Bigger map (32x32)?
*   Get rid of (or add more to) `RESET_TO_KNOWN`
    *   Check other areas that might need reset logic
*   See if we can fix antennas and fanout issues:
    *   Try fiddling with target density
    *   Try increasing clock speed a bit (35MHz target could be good for 800x600, etc?)
    *   File to check is: `wokwi\logs\signoff\40-antenna.log`
*   Texture overflow could be because we go 1 pixel more than mirror?


[Submit Project]: https://app.tinytapeout.com/projects/136/submit

## Doco

*   Screenshot of textures in tt04-raybox-zero README
*   Updated screenshot in raybox-zero README?
*   Photo of device running on FPGA?



# IMPORTANT and time-consuming stuff

*   Dither can be turned on/off via one of the primary inputs.
*   Use all the other IO pins - inc. debug stuff
*   VGA timing control parameters
*   "Other player" register pair -- SPI to set it, FSM logic to detect it, colour control
*   Basic 1-bit sprite with colour register

# Done

*   Test on FPGA: Works with DE0-Nano and PicoDeo.
*   Buy initial submission!
*   Different wall IDs - also requires:
    *   Map generator to suit, but that can just be a separate bit of logic for that bit plane.
    *   Different texture generators.
*   Debug overlay (more important than map overlay) -- gets its own pin to force it on
*   Simple demo stuff (assert an input to do a rolling increment of playerX or Y)
*   Frame start signal
*   Visible line/frame end signal (blanking signals)
*   Wall texture underflow clamp
*   Texture overflow (upper edge) clamping
*   Floor 'leak' option (though not accessible yet)
*   Registered outputs
*   SPI module - lots of work, but enables other things

# Cancelled

*   SPI2 stuff:
    *   Mux between raw outputs and registered outputs: Not needed if we have a direct IO to control it.
    *   Ceiling leak.

# TODO

*   Pull notes from iPhone
*   cocotb and other tests
*   Look for `@@@`, `SMELL`s, `TODO`s, etc.
*   Colour bar at the bottom (or side) showing all 64 colours.
*   Does it make sense to change view parameters during trace? Not sure, given how the FSM works
*   Better (general) SPI controller
*   SPI control over various advanced things:
    *   "Other player" register that can just occupy a map cell, and it can be a different pattern
    *   Dithering
    *   "Load now" override instead of ready at end of frame
    *   Floor/ceiling colour:
        *   One mode could be LFSR with colour, parameters/taps, and offset
        *   Another could be "gradient" -- configurable colour bands: 20 total (320 divided by slices 16 wide): 20x6 = 120b, or 240b if different floor/ceiling bands.
        *   'Ambient occlusion': Shaded region using cross-hatch of a darker colour, for a small number of pixels before/after line rendering.
    *   Different texture modes
    *   Debug stuff
    *   Overlays on/off
    *   SOME access to change map, e.g. some rows are RAM, if not all
    *   VGA timing alts: Good for testing different chip speeds
*   Metastability stuff?
*   Debug signals in case the chip doesn't work
*   QSPI read background from external memory at 320x480 resolution
*   Texture ideas:
    *   "Panels"
    *   Bricks or basket weave - esp. Mario style
    *   Fractal
    *   The map itself is a texture... but this is a problem for dual access.
    *   Try and get minimal blue wall texture in as a ROM -- Look at Uri's ID#0 ROM embedding, for example.
        *   It could be just 2 bits for blue, 2 bits for green, and then red is generated (or swapped) for alt colour.
        *   Another way of thinking about it:
            *   Black
            *   3 'colour' levels (blues)
            *   2 grey levels
            *   That's only 6 colours in total, so it only needs 3 bits per pixel (and 2 colours spare; white for one?): 64x64x3 = 12kbit. Reduce to 32x32x4 (ugly) and it would be 4kbit.
            *   Colour levels can use logic to make them blue, red, or green... or even cyan, magenta, yellow too.
*   Check antennas and other reports e.g. fanout.
*   Check [possible saturation check error in reciprocal](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero/blob/b4dc3cb855a0aca4901be960c2d8dec7310843e7/src/rtl/reciprocal.v#L108-L112)


# After submission

*   Doco and images
*   PicoDeo and raybox-game.py release
*   tt04-solo-squash with SPI
*   Design PCB, esp. VGA DAC. Offer it to Matt as a PMOD.

# Notes

*   readmem and UTF-16
