# Setting up tt04-solo-squash to use solo_squash submodule

*   Created `submodule` branch: `git checkout -b submodule`
*   Add submodule: `git submodule add git@github.com:algofoogle/solo_squash src/solo_squash`
*   Should `top.v` be part of `solo_squash` or remain in `tt04-solo-squash`?
    Probably keep in tt04-solo-squash because it is specific to that project/repo's needs.
*   Load `top.v` first, so it can set any `` `define ``s that it wants to.
*   Matched reset polarity.
*   Pushed `solo_squash` repo changes.
*   After tiny corrections, the GHAs work now with the solo_squash submodule. GDS builds fine.

## Windows sync speed estimation

Verilator clock estimation was wrong on Windows:

```
Starting simulation in 3... 2... 1... Cold start...
Main loop...
[H,V,F= 751,  33, 3] Horizontal auto-adjust to 48 after HSYNC
[H,V,F= 751,  33, 3] Vertical frame auto-shift to 33 after VSYNC
Current FPS: 47.90 - Total average FPS: 47.90 - m_tickcount=  0,019,713,600 (  0,002,528,673 Hz;  10% of target)
Current FPS: 50.65 - Total average FPS: 49.20 - m_tickcount=  0,041,133,600 (  0,004,210,656 Hz;  16% of target)
...
Current FPS: 50.80 - Total average FPS: 49.74 - m_tickcount=  0,188,973,600 (  0,004,223,237 Hz;  16% of target)
Current FPS: 51.03 - Total average FPS: 49.86 - m_tickcount=  0,210,813,600 (  0,000,358,354 Hz;   1% of target)
Current FPS: 49.26 - Total average FPS: 49.80 - m_tickcount=  0,231,813,600 (  0,003,763,675 Hz;  15% of target)
Done at 322953600 ticks.
```

50fps is much better than 15% of target performance, and that 1% figure is way off.

It turned out to be [a weird error that I had to work around](https://github.com/algofoogle/solo_squash/commit/f6efb6849e7d32859ad37e8d9ff67b463a4a8826#diff-2f1666fc46c35f596afa85eb039f8cbd5f9132cffdff39fbab1c5952dd393317R279-R287)
where somewhere along the line what should've been a 64-bit `long` was being truncated to 32 bits,
but only when compiled for Windows. Maybe a bug related to MinGW?


## Next steps

*   Update READMEs
*   Need instructions on how to:
    *   Clone/pull submodule, inc. updates to it
    *   Update submodule commit/tag reference
*   TOP module simulation:
    Need to implement a way to simulate the tt04-solo-squash top module (say, with Verilator),
    so that we can make sure its behaviours seems right with the extra metastability avoidance
    stuff we've got in there (i.e. `input_sync`) and the wiring of other debug signals.
*   Do gate-level simulation.
*   Implement different output modes with a way to select:
    *   RGB111: It does this currently.
    *   RGB222 with temporal ordered dither (to use just 3 outputs).
    *   RGB222 without speaker (to use 6 outputs).

# Notes

*   `config.tcl` from tt04-submission-template has some interesting stuff in it.
*   It sets the target clock speed to 50MHz (20ns period). For me, this could be an issue if I only need a 25MHz
    clock for VGA, and my design is sophisticated enough that it can't get above this due to propagation delays
    on all my heavy combo logic.
