# Setting up tt04-solo-squash to use solo_squash submodule

*   Created `submodule` branch: `git checkout -b submodule`
*   Add submodule: `git submodule add git@github.com:algofoogle/solo_squash src/solo_squash`
*   Should `top.v` be part of `solo_squash` or remain in `tt04-solo-squash`?
    Probably keep in tt04-solo-squash because it is specific to that project/repo's needs.
*   Load `top.v` first, so it can set any `` `define ``s that it wants to.
*   Matched reset polarity.
*   Pushed `solo_squash` repo changes.
*   After tiny corrections, the GHAs work now with the solo_squash submodule. GDS builds fine.

## Windows sync speed estimation

Verilator clock estimation was wrong on Windows:

```
Starting simulation in 3... 2... 1... Cold start...
Main loop...
[H,V,F= 751,  33, 3] Horizontal auto-adjust to 48 after HSYNC
[H,V,F= 751,  33, 3] Vertical frame auto-shift to 33 after VSYNC
Current FPS: 47.90 - Total average FPS: 47.90 - m_tickcount=  0,019,713,600 (  0,002,528,673 Hz;  10% of target)
Current FPS: 50.65 - Total average FPS: 49.20 - m_tickcount=  0,041,133,600 (  0,004,210,656 Hz;  16% of target)
...
Current FPS: 50.80 - Total average FPS: 49.74 - m_tickcount=  0,188,973,600 (  0,004,223,237 Hz;  16% of target)
Current FPS: 51.03 - Total average FPS: 49.86 - m_tickcount=  0,210,813,600 (  0,000,358,354 Hz;   1% of target)
Current FPS: 49.26 - Total average FPS: 49.80 - m_tickcount=  0,231,813,600 (  0,003,763,675 Hz;  15% of target)
Done at 322953600 ticks.
```

50fps is much better than 15% of target performance, and that 1% figure is way off.

It turned out to be [a weird error that I had to work around](https://github.com/algofoogle/solo_squash/commit/f6efb6849e7d32859ad37e8d9ff67b463a4a8826#diff-2f1666fc46c35f596afa85eb039f8cbd5f9132cffdff39fbab1c5952dd393317R279-R287)
where somewhere along the line what should've been a 64-bit `long` was being truncated to 32 bits,
but only when compiled for Windows. Maybe a bug related to MinGW?


## Next steps

*   Update READMEs
*   Need instructions on how to:
    *   Clone/pull submodule, inc. updates to it
    *   Update submodule commit/tag reference
*   TOP module simulation:
    Need to implement a way to simulate the tt04-solo-squash top module (say, with Verilator),
    so that we can make sure its behaviours seems right with the extra metastability avoidance
    stuff we've got in there (i.e. `input_sync`) and the wiring of other debug signals.
*   Do gate-level simulation.
*   Implement different output modes with a way to select:
    *   RGB111: It does this currently.
    *   RGB222 with temporal ordered dither (to use just 3 outputs).
    *   RGB222 without speaker (to use 6 outputs).


# Overall design plan for tt04-solo-squash submission

Here's my spec for tt04-solo-squash:

*   Remove LZC.
*   Ideally the game should support free-running so long as it gets
    reset. This means still supporting up/down keys by default.
*   Control via SPI (3 inputs needed, unless we can work without `SS`).
    *   Buffered until a frame is ready to load the data.
    *   Can set the paddle position directly.
    *   Optionally could set paddle size, ball size, and ball motion.
    *   Optionally can set/reset pause mode?
    *   Optionally could select between registered and direct outputs?
*   Other inputs:
    *   Pause.
    *   New Game.
    *   Down/Up will still increment/decrement paddle position once per
        frame, even if set via SPI.
*   Outputs:
    *   HSYNC
    *   VSYNC
    *   R, G, B
    *   Speaker
*   Debug ports?
*   READING some info via SPI MISO?
*   VBLANK IRQ?
*   Should we try having a mode that can read from an external memory
    and display it on screen, with a configurable divider for different
    pixel widths? As an experiment, we could make this one of:
    *   A "sprite" for the ball.
    *   A repeating pattern for the background, either 1-bit or RGB222?
        For example, we could use 6 ROM bits to provide RGB222 colours,
        with 4 of those bits via dedicated inputs, and the other 2 via
        bidirs, then use the remaining 6 bidirs as ROM address (64 pixels,
        which could be arranged, say, as 8x8 pixels). **WAIT: NO GOOD.**
        If we do this, we have no inputs left for SPI.
    *   A pattern for the walls?
    *   Some other overlay/logo/text or whatever.
*   Other ideas:
    *   Is there a way to give this a score? Based on time between misses,
        or maybe counting bounces?
    *   Multiple designs in one, selectable via SPI.
    *   Ability to configure patterns via registers that turn on/off certain
        bitwise logic combos.
    *   Controlling VGA timing via SPI?


# Notes

*   `config.tcl` from tt04-submission-template has some interesting stuff in it.
*   It sets the target clock speed to 50MHz (20ns period). For me, this could be an issue if I only need a 25MHz
    clock for VGA, and my design is sophisticated enough that it can't get above this due to propagation delays
    on all my heavy combo logic.
*   Other TT04 ideas:
    *   General VGA device:
        *   Optional SPI control.
        *   Configurable timing.
        *   Experiments in un/registered outputs.
        *   Experiments in reading external memory.
        *   Route inputs to various VGA outputs, while blanking them
            via `visible` gate.
        *   Trying out minimal "framebuffer" using a small number of DFFs or DFFRAM?
        *   Modes to try out other VGA "games" and tests.
        *   Delta-based bit packing of raycaster column heights, e.g. we could assume
            most inter-column height deltas will fit within 4 bits (+/- 8 height steps), and a counter could be used to specify how many "regular" columns
            there are before a break that exceeds this 4-bit range.
            We could assume that there won't ever be more than 32 "extreme" columns,
            so: 32x4bits for counters + 32x6bits for extreme (reset) values +
            128x4bits for steps. This is 832 bits for 160x120 (not inc. 'side')
            which would normally take 160x6 (960 bits), but I'm sure we could do better.
        *   How efficient would it be to RLE column heights, even??
            Hmm, a single 45-degree wall angle would be enough to bust it.
